# Part 3

## Overview

Progress report (in the form of your answers to the Google Form below).

The finish line is in sight! You should have your data in hand and some models made. This portion of the Capstone contains two parts to help really hone your model and develop mastery over your final project.

*Goal*: A progress report (answers to the Google Form below + updated GitHub repo) on your project and a detailed 1:1 (optional) with one of your instructors. If you would like to schedule a 1:1, please reach out to the instructor/IA you would like to meet with to schedule.

## Requirements

The actual deliverable for this section is fairly small. You are expected to submit your responses to the questions on [this Google form](TBD) as a progress report detailing where you are with your Capstone. You will also include a link to your updated GitHub repository including visual and statistical analysis. In the Google Form, you will provide detailed answers to the following questions:

1. Do you have data fully in hand and if not, what blockers are you facing?
2. Have you done full EDA on all of your data?
3. Have you begun the modeling process? How accurate are your predictions so far?
4. What blockers are you facing, including processing power, data acquisition, modeling difficulties, data cleaning, etc.? How can we help you overcome those challenges?
5. Have you changed topics since your lightning talk? Since you submitted your Problem Statement and EDA? If so, do you have the necessary data in hand (and the requisite EDA completed) to continue moving forward?
6. What is your timeline for the next week and a half? What do you _have_ to get done versus what would you _like_ to get done?
7. Are you planning to reach out to schedule another capstone check-in with an instructor/IA next week? If "yes" to the above, what topics do you want to discuss during your 1:1?

We will use your progress report as a leaping off point for your optional 1:1 with a member of the instructional team. The best use of your time is to really flesh out your progress report so that your remaining time here can be most productive.
