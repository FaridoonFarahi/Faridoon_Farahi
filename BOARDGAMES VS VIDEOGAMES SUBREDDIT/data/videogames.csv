"I was recently realizing that I really like when developers try to show progress through in-game visuals. I first remember being struck by this in Prince of Persia as your outfit lost sleeves and got cut up. I also fondly remember going to my gun range in Hitman and testing all the guns I'd brought back from missions. I enjoyed watch the manors in Assassin Creed clean up and start to house my collectibles and weapons. I enjoy visiting the armory in XCOM 2 and seeing my growing collection of Alien trophies. I like base building games but I also really like when the developers pre-establish these displays for me.  

Does anyone else enjoy when you get in-game displays of your progress instead of just information in a menu or a progress bar?

What are your favorite executions of this?",videogames,In-game displays of collectibles and progress
"There was this game I played 10-12 years ago it was like fable/diablo 3, in that it's a fantasy setting, chest to loot, goblins to kill and chest to horde loot. In the character menu it shows where you can duel wield or equip a bow. It also had scythes that the heads are sickles.",videogames,I'm having nostalgic amnesia.
"So: i'm trying to remember the name of this game (pretty sure it is a PC game). It's a 2d side scroller. Your character is kinda like a medieval peasant. You get challenged (at least that's how i remember it) by a knight and after you defeat him, you keep his sword and a strange artifact that is like a save point (if you get killed, you start where you throw that object that projects like a hologram of your character). If you move right, you enter a cave where a monkey and a crow are fighting, the monkey wins and he starts fighting you. If you go left, you encounter a shaman like character that runs away and send an armored bear and an armored goat to fight you... tell me you guys remember this game! It was all over youtube some years ago!",videogames,HELP! I'M GOING CRAZY!

"Its all started 2 years ago when i turned 20 and some people started to shame me over playing video games and i have also seen people who quit playing them because they got older but for me i play video games at least 6 hours a day and i don't want quit but my emotion is telling me a different thing. I feel like its anppropriate to play video games at this age and every time i play a game i get that feeling of shame and gulit and to be honest even awkwardness. It lefts me confused about video games, because i don't know if its okay to keep playing games anymore i feel like i should get new hobbies, hobbies that are appropriate to my age and the people around me. 

I would love to see some help here and i would also love to hear if somone went through a similar experience.",videogames,As much as it pains me to say this but i have been feeling gulit and shame while playing video games because i feel like im too old to enjoy them even though i like video games soo much

"I'm not quite sure how to feel about this game now.  20 years ago as someone just entering their teenage years I thought it was incredible.  Don't get me wrong, I still felt the nostalgia but it was extremely shoet lived after the 5 bosses the game had to offer.  This at least opens the door for me to start on ZOE2, which I've heard mixed reviews on.

The overall positives for me.  

The nostalgic feelings, the music, and the gameplay in general.  There are three series that always come to mind when it comes to musical scores and soundtracks, the Final Fantasy series, Metal Gear Solid, and Nier/Drakengard (separate game I know, but contentiously the same universe).  Considering this game released early in PS2's life, I felt it pushed the edge on battle mechanics.  It was fast paced, and relatively smooth when negating the annoying camera panning.

The cons

How short the game was.  I remember this game taking much more time when I was younger.  I guess being older now and with more games under my belt, I was able to breeze through this.  My current playthrough was 7 hours and a good chunk of that time was leaving the system on while I was taking care of odds and ends.

The CONS CONS

Underwhelming character development.  Sure yeah, we get an idea of who Leo is, but what about Celvice.  Who is she, where did she come from, what is her background?  What about Atlantis, who are they, how can we trust them?  That's a lot of balls to accept a mission without regard or thought to who you may be helping.

I understand these are things that have been well more than covered over the years.  I just found it interesting how my views are different to how I first remember them.",videogames,So I replayed Zone of the Enders again 20 years later
Ok i just got a memory in a dream and i couldn't find this anywhere but i need help. I used to have this mobile game a long time ago like maybe 6-7 years but i can't find it. All i remember about it or what i think it was is that is was a side scrolling running game and i think you had to collect candles? I'm not to sure but i think it was some sort of animal that you played as and you had a power up that made you a super hero. I'm really not sure if its around or if anyone remembers it but i can't get it out of my head.,videogames,I know i can't be the only one.

"Okay, so, there was a PC game I played as a kid (late 90's- early 2000's) that I think was part of a pack that was downloaded onto the computer, no disk needed. I think Putt-Putt was also part of the pack. In the game you were a wizards apprentice running around a castle. I just have a distinct memory of a potions room where you would mix various colored potions to recreate a specific color/potions. If I recall correctly your character had red hair (weird detail but I recall it). You also climbed through tunnels within the castle. I think the goal was to save someone?

"When will ppl realize that graphics truly doesn’t matter? Ppl keep saying things like  “oh I want a game with a really good storyline” or “I want a game with a unique playstyle” and then when they see how subjectively “bad” are the visuals they totally and ignorantly disregard the one thing that the dev(s) did their very best to create for us players, a video game. and they don’t even give it a chance to actually do the most decent and convincing way to do, to ACTUALLY try the game. And there are MANY other ways you can experience the game if you didn’t have the chance and/or money to get it. How would you expect me to be convinced with uninteresting words when all your short-sighted eyes can see in a video game is the visuals or how “it looked like”? Just because a video game is old and/or has funny looking graphics doesn’t mean that you’re 100% right. No you’re wrong, I don’t even want to give out examples to make this post even more controversial but there ARE in fact certain video games that the makers paid lots of money and income from the sweat of their glands just to make the graphics “good” enough for ppl to buy the product but literally has little to no ideal charm of the other things that are WAY more important like story, characters, soundtrack, design and gameplay. And there are REALLY good ones that conceptually and narratively speaking make you forget about how mundane and unimportant “good graphics” are. GIVE the game a chance! It’s OK to try the game and dedicate your time to it without having the outcome you’ve expected to be having. It’s OK to try a game you didn’t end up liking JUST as it’s OK to try a game that you DID in fact end up loving. How do you expect yourself to widen your special explorations when all you do is whine over how “bad” or “ugly” this game’s graphics look? This could say a lot of things about you.

"The game would be called overdrive, about a edgy dual wielding dagger like swordsman 🗡️D.J.,  holding one like a actual sword and one like a dagger, with cloud like anime style hair but brown, with a hooded or non hooded ninja look.

Important Note 2: I'll still be able to keep my Nintendo DS and PS3 games. I'm only throwing away PS2 and gameboy stuff.

————————————————————————
Story


Level 1: The Sewers

The game will start off with a brand new character, Trinity, having a nightmare where she’s been cornered by a barber wielding a large pair of scissors, right as the barber stabs the scissor into her, she wakes up and finds herself in the sewers underneath the Pale City. Upon waking up, she is clearly frustrated, annoyed even. She makes her way through the sewers and soon encounters the first enemies in the game, Plagued Rats. These rats are feral and aggressive, but are easily scared by flame. Throughout the room would be torches, and Trinity would need to run from torch to torch, avoiding the rats, but soon the torches will all be blown out by a sudden gust of wind and Trinity will need to outrun the rats, sliding through a small hole and escaping the rat swarm.
Soon, she makes it out of there and would need to do some platforming, jumping from wooden platform to wooden platform, if she falls into the water then she’ll be dragged down by the main enemy of the Sewer Level...

Upon going through the platforming section, Trinity would walk past a large candlelit room, where the shadow of a large looming figure is shown on the wall, the creature seemed to possess sharp teeth and appears to take notice of Trinity, as he dives into the water and pursues Trinity from underneath the water. Trinity must run from the sewer monster as he swims after her, as he swims towards her, the wooden platforms would rattle and topple over as the monster swam underneath it, so she needs to run and jump from platform to platform before he reaches her.
Soon she jumps into a tunnel, and the monster gives up its pursuit for the time being. 

Trinity soon stumbled upon a pile of bones, roughly the size of a regular human. The sewer monster is a cannibal who not only feasts on children, but feasts on adults and just about anything that moves. In the same room, Trinity obtains a lighter, this lighter will prove to be incredibly useful in the next room.

Trinity enters a room that is once again filled with rats, but through the use of the lighter, the rats will be unable to harm Trinity due to the fire in her hand, and as a result, while the rats will surround Trinity trying to get at her, they’ll be unable to make a single move. She can move through this area with ease using the lighter.

The sewer monster would be in the next room, where Trinity must sneak as quietly as possible as to not alert the Monster who can see sounds. If located, the monster would lunge out of the water and grab hold of Trinity, giving her head a quick chomp. Trinity will need to make her way to the end of the room, where a lever is located. When the lever is pushed, it would generate a loud noise and Trinity will once again have to run, sliding and jumping over obstacles. The monster soon jumped out of the water and runs after her on foot, crashing through wooden barricades and pipes just to try and catch Trinity.
Soon, Trinity runs towards a large set of metal bars which leads to the exit of the sewers, Trinity, being a small children, would slip through the metal bars while the Sewer Monster is unable to slip through, reaching out to try and grab Trinity before eventually giving up and swimming away...




Level 2: The Barber Shop

Trinity swam to shore, washing up along a harbor. A large clocktower looms in the distance with the sound of a bell echoing throughout the city, Trinity takes out a small pocket watch from her pocket and checks the time, before continuing on. Every other alleyway and path is either blocked off or are inhabited by the fat gluttons from the first game.

The only place for Trinity to go is a large barber shop, which has a line of customers in front. Trinity can enter the barber shop through the vents. While sneaking through the vents, Trinity will sneak over the barber’s workroom, where the player can get their first look at the barber, a tall and slender man wearing a black and white apron, his face devoid of emotion. Each guest is taking turns sitting in the barber’s seat in order to get their hair completely shaven off, rendering them bald. Soon Trinity will make her way into a storage room filled with equipments, from razors to scissors. She would cause a ruckus by knocking some items over, attracting the Barber who would enter the storage room to clean the mess up, leaving the storage door open. Trinity can sneak out of the storage room and use some nearby boxes as cover from the guests. She will sneak out of the barber’s workshop and into his office, where a puzzle must be solved that involves placing several barber equipments in the right cups. Soon, a painting of the barber would slide up revealing a small storage space with a key in it. Trinity can obtain the key, but then must quickly hide as the sound of scissors snipping can be heard.

The barber bursts into the room with a large pair of scissors in hand, enraged upon finding the key was taken. He begins searching around the room, looking underneath the couch then inside a drawer, Trinity must make a run for it at this very moment, running through the halls of the building while the Barber follows closely behind. Trinity runs into a room with an open door, the bedroom, and find a hiding space (preferably underneath the bed), The Barber charges into the room and begins to carefully search all around, snipping his scissors as a means of taunting Trinity. After a while of searching, he gives up and leaves the room.

Another puzzle is in this room, where Trinity must replace the pendulum in a clock. Upon completing the puzzle, the floor beneath the barber’s bed moves aside revealing a hatch underneath the barber’s bed. Trinity can use the key to unlock the hatch and make her way into, pushing open a large wooden door and entering a room that contains a single dead corpse impaled to the wall with a giant scissor. Hanging on a hook next to the corpse is a key that can unlock the back door of the establishment. After taking the key, Trinity heads towards the entrance door of the room.

Suddenly, a pair of scissors pierces through the door, the Barber is now on the other side of the door, ramming his scissors against the door in an attempt to knock it down. Trinity can yank the scissor out from the dead corpse in the room and drags it towards the door, where she rams the large scissor through the door and stab the barber through the guts, killing him. 

Trinity soon makes her way out of the room where the Barber can be seen bleeding out on the floor, and using the new key she had obtained, she can finally unlock the back door of the building and leave the barbershop.


Level 3: The Antique Store

Trinity walks out into the cold and rainy city, where the distant clock tower chimes again. Trinity makes her way into a warm and cozy antique store, slipping through the door just as a guest was leaving. She takes out her pocket watch again and checks the time, letting out a quiet whimper before putting it away. She hides behind a large counter as the sound of pages flipping can be heard, and The Collector can be seen for the first time, dressed in an expensive suit and wearing a strange gold mask that blocked his mouth completely, his hands had several needles attached to them like claws, and he wore The Collector turns around and suddenly walks right through a cabinet, phasing through like a ghost. 

Trinity must climb the cabinet which was filled with rare and antique items and navigate the maze like room, avoiding The Collector who is just below. It’s shown that everything The Collector’s left hand touches turns to gold, almost like the Midas Touch, Trinity is soon forced to knock over a vase to progress, causing it to shatter. The Collector instantly looks up before seemingly disappearing into a cloud of smoke.
As Trinity gets to the end of the room, she climbs down from the cabinets. This is when The Collector finally comes out of hiding, phasing through a bookshelf and giving chase, Trinity must run through a corridor to try and evade him, while he phases through walls and doors, trying to catch Trinity, his left hand reaches out for her the entire time he’s giving chase.


Trinity soon charges into a room filled with golden statues of children, pushing through them and climbing a cabinet. When Trinity reaches the top of the cabinet, The Collector is unable to catch her, but still relentlessly reaches up to try and grab her. Trinity can used this opportunity to jump onto a motionless ceiling fan, using that platform as a way reach a nearby vent.

Trinity soon enters a library, landing on top of a bookshelf. The Collector follows her into the Library, looking up at her with his left hand reaching out. As Trinity jumps from bookshelf to bookshelf, The Collector follows closely underneath, ready to grab her if she slips up. Soon, Trinity enters another vent in the ceiling, but as she goes through the vents, occasionally The Collector’s hand phases through into the vents and would search around for Trinity before disappearing.

Eventually, Trinity makes it out and lands in the middle of a long corridor, where The Collector once again gives chase. Trinity must run to the end of the corridor towards a ladder that leads to the attic, climbing up and running to the end of the attic towards a large window displaying the outdoors. Trinity is soon cornered by The Collector who approaches her, reaching out with his left hand, The Collector then lunges at her. Trinity dives out of the way at the last second, causing The Collector to phase through the window and fall to his death outside.

Trinity leaves the attic and takes an elevator that brings her to the roof of the building...


Level 4: The Slums 

Trinity makes it to the roof of the building, the Clock Tower once again looming in the background, much closer this time than it had been before, she sprints to the edge of the building and jumps onto another roof, climbing down a ladder and entering the slums of the Pale City

Upon first entering the slum, a dead corpse can immediately be found with crows picking at it, suddenly the sound of gunshots can be heard and upon approaching where the gunshot was heard, two more bodies were found on the ground with a bullet wound in the forehead, the corpses appear to be dressed in a rather expensive clothing and they were incredibly bloated.

Soon, the shooter is identified, as Trinity hides inside a cart full of rotten meat, a man wearing a trench coat and a western hat could be seen holding a rifle in his hands, he walked past several slim inhabitants of the Slum, all of whom were skinny and dressed in dirty clothing. Trinity must make her way through the slums, avoiding the line of sights, before eventually reaching a small shack and entering through a small hole in the wall. 

Upon entering the shack, Trinity seems well-acquainted with the place, there were two beds in the shack, a large one and a smaller one, suddenly the Shooter from earlier entered the shack and seemed shocked to find Trinity in there. There was a moment of hesitation between the two, before the shooter pulled out his rifle and aimed it at Trinity, hesitating on shooting her. Instead, he approached her and knocked her out using the rifle instead.

Trinity soon woke up and the first thing she did was check the time on her pocket watch, gasping in shock when she sees the time. She takes out her lighter and uses it to burn off the ropes that kept the cage closed, stepping out and leaving the room through a small hole in the ground.

She crawled underneath the ground, hearing some loud stomping above her, The Shooter was right above her counting through several bags of coins. The Shooter could hear some faint shuffling underneath the floorboards and grabs a revolver, shooting at the floor. The Shooter fires his gun six times at a specific location ahead of Trinity, and she must wait until he reloads before crawling forward. Trinity soon crawls out through a hole on the side of the building and runs through the slum, the Shooter firing his rifle from the window of his shack. 

Trinity must use nearby objects and pedestrians as cover from the bullets, The Shooter will shoot down objects and civilians without hesitation in order to eat to Trinity, eventually he charges out of his house and runs after her as she slide through a crack underneath another house. Sticking the end of his rifle inside the crack, he attempts to shoot Trinity, disturbing the residents of that house who barges out and voices his complaint with The Shooter, temporarily distracting him. Trinity can take this time to grab a nearby object that can be lodged into the muzzle, and the next time The Shooter fires, the gun recoils and flies out of his hand.

The Shooter is visibly annoyed, but he pulls out his revolver and is ready to try and shoot Trinity again. Suddenly, a resident of the slum charged at him, swinging a plank across his head and knocking him to the ground, soon all the residents United and beat The Shooter to death as punishment for killing several residents earlier and disturbing the peace. Trinity seems rather shaken by what she just saw, crawling out towards the corpse of The Shooter to check if he’s dead, his head had been completely caved in. Trinity remained still for a few short seconds, before turning ad continuing on...


Level 5: The Clocktower

Trinity soon reaches the Clocktower, which is nearly reaching midnight now. Trinity hurries into the Clocktower and has to deal with another puzzle that deals with moving the hands of three clocks into the correct order. Upon completion, a large gate would open emitting a glowing purple light.

Trinity enters a large grand room and must now perform a platforming section, using the gears and twisting mechanisms of the Clocktower as platforms. Upon reaching the top of the Clocktower, Trinity would approach a generator responsible for powering up the Clocktower. Trinity can grab a nearby metal pipe and begin swinging it at the generator in an attempt to destroy it, as she does this, frantic screaming and whispering can be heard in the background. Soon, Trinity destroys the generator and the entire Clocktower powers down.

A dark purple cloud of smoke will fly out of the generator upon its destruction and will transform into a large crooked man, he appears to be hunched over and his fingers are long and bony, he begins to approach Trinity, and she must now make her escape by going through the same platforming section from earlier (though this time it’d be a lot easier due to the deactivation of the Clocktower itself) 

As Trinity runs, occasionally, time appears to reverse and Trinity would be brought ever closer to The Crooked Man who is unaffected by the time manipulation. 

Trinity would soon reach the bottom and must run back towards the entrance of the Clocktower, suddenly time appears to fast forward, the bell in the Clocktower appears to collapse and land right in front of the entrance, blocking Trinity’s path. The Clocktower itself now appears more rundown compared to what it looked like before.

The Crooked Man seems to be able to control time within this tower, Trinity must run towards a large hole in the wall of the Clocktower (a hole that wasn’t there before when first entering, but the hole has now appeared due to the fact that time has forwarded)

Trinity runs through the wall and must navigate her way through a series of steam pipes, all the while the Crooked Man attempts to grab at her. Soon, Trinity appears to outrun the Crooked man temporarily, giving her time to breathe.

Trinity must now enter an elevator that takes her to the very top of the Clocktower, upon leaving the elevator, Trinity can stop and look at the view from up there, overlooking most of the Pale City, from The Sewers, to The Barber Ship, to the Auction Store and the Slum, even the Signal Tower can be spotted in the distance.

Trinity stops and takes out her pocket watch once again, seeing that the watch has seemed to stop. The pouring rain suddenly stops in mid-air, and The Crooked Man enters the roof, slowly approaching Trinity.

At this moment, with her pocket watch in hand, Trinity stays put instead of running away. The Crooked Man appears to be amused, stopping right in front of Trinity with a strange smile on his face. Trinity then has two options

Open The Pocket Watch

Destroy The Pocket Watch


If Trinity opens the Pocket Watch, The Crooked Man appears to be afraid and immediately crawls back. A bright glowing light emits from the Pocket Watch, and as Trinity approaches The Crooked Man, he continues to crawl back until eventually backing against a wall. Trinity continues to approach the Crooked Man, who lets out one final scream before a bright light fills the screen.

As the light disappears, Trinity finds herself waking up, once again in the Sewers of the Pale City. Trinity lets out a defeated sigh before sitting down, waiting for the Sewer Monster to get to her



If Trinity chooses to destroy the Pocket Watch, she can grab a nearby hammer, dragging it towards the watch on the grab and smashing it. The Crooked Man seems to get physically hurt from this. Trinity strikes it once again, causing the Crooked Man to stumble back. Strike it once more and a bright glowing light appears to emit from the watch. Trinity can strike it one final time, causing the watch to explode into pieces. 

The Crooked Man begins to shriek as his body seems to break down, he crawls towards Trinity, trying to grab at her, the light from within the Pocket Watch begins to glow once more, and The Crooked Man appears to be sucked into the light, being trapped and contained within it. 

Trinity picks up the shattered pieces of the pocket watch, giving it one last look before tossing it off the Clock Tower. Trinity approached the bright glowing light, the same light that now contains The Crooked Man inside it. Trinity reaches out to touch it, and as she does so, time appears to stop once again. The light appears to enter Trinity, flowing through her, Trinity begins to hunch over as her body begins to turn Crooked.

—————————————————————————

Story Explained


Basically, Trinity is stuck in a time loop, every time she dies she wakes back up in the Sewers, and once it passes midnight the same would happen, Trinity would wake in the sewers. This is why Trinity keeps checking her pocket watch every so often, to check how much time she has left until time reverses again.

This same time loop is somewhat responsible for Mono and Six’s story, the Clocktower is what allowed Mono to use the signal tower to communicate with the past. By stopping the clock, Trinity has blocked Mono off from the past and therefore ending the cycle/loop involving Six and Mono’s betrayal.

In the end, Trinity obtains The Crooked Man’s power, gaining control of the Clock Tower. In return, her back turned Crooked just like the man to symbolize how she has now obtained his abilities.

Meanwhile, in the “Open the Pocket Watch” ending, The Crooked Man was able to reverse time once again, bringing Trinity all the way back to the beginning of the game. Trinity sighs in defeat and seemingly accepts her fate. 

————————————————————————

Difficulty 

Unlike the other games in the series, this game has four “difficulties”

There’s the normal mode, which plays like the other games. When you die you respawn at the last checkpoint and you can take all the time you want


There’s “Trial” mode, where you get a time limit and must speed through the game before the clock strikes midnight, ending the game.

There’s “Undead” mode, where if you die once, you will be brought back to the very beginning of the game.

Then there’s the “Nightmare” mode, where you must complete the game before the clock strikes midnight, AND if you die you’ll be brought all the way back

—————————————————————————

Collectibles

There are various collectibles to get throughout the game, from hats, to masks.


If you complete the game with the “Open” ending, you obtained Mono’s hat. Completing the “Destroy” ending gives you Six’s hoodie 

Both endings will gives you the “Cursed Trinity” skin, which is the Crooked Trinity at the end of the game

In the barber shop, there will be three gold items, a gold scissor, gold razor and a gold shampoo bottle. Collecting all three will give Trinity the Barber’s apron.

In the Antique Store, there will be five special antiques to collect, getting all five will give the “Golden Girl” skin, which is Trinity with a gold tint over her

In the Slums, ten coins will be scattered around, collecting all ten will gives Trinity the Shooter’s hat and trenchcoat.

But video games that I am trying to avoid are ones that are too violent, easy to die, bad graphics, and limited character customization, and bird eye.

also never forget about the potato

""European adoption of potato was slow but steady. In the beginning, Spanish government used potato as a reliable and easily transported food for their military and navy who while using them did not succumb to the scurvy. Potato arrived to Britain in 1585, Belgium and Germany in 1587, Austria in 1588, Ireland in 1589 and France in 1600. Sadly, local population of those countries looked at potato as absolutely unneeded, weird, poisonous (only roots of the plant were edible, which was totally unheard off in Europe), and in some cases as downright evil. For many years, potato was accused for causing leprosy, syphilis, early death, sterility, rampant sexuality, scrofula, narcosis and for destroying the soil where it grew. This sentiment receded from the Europe only after large scale efforts of France to find food that would sustain not only their military, but also population that was starved from continuous warfare. Long examination of the potato by the famous French botanist and chemist Antoine-Augustin Parmentier finally paid off when he persuaded King of France Louis XVI (1754–1793) to encourage mass cultivation of this plant my tricking the population. King gave Parmentier funds and land to grow 100 acres of potato, which were carefully guarded by military guards. Such large military and government attention on guarding these potatoes instantly sparked the attention of the people, who after that started adopting potato more and more until it became one of the most popular food sources in the Europe. The wife of the French king Marie Antoinette (1755-1793) also contributed by pining potato flowers in her curls, a move that was quickly emulated by noble ladies all across the Europe.""",videogames,censorship... censorship never dies.

there was this one video game i played when i was like 5 to 7. it was very weird and confused me a lot, but i want to revisit it. it starts with you moving to a town where the builder moved away and the town is kind of in decay. anyways you had to move in and be the builder. first you had to build your own house, and they gave you lots of room and tools to do so. the story got increasingly weird, to the point where after about 2 hours of gamemplay, you had to create a lectern or something of that sort out of 4 apples, but there was no recipe to do so, no lectern recipe, and the mayor got increasingly angry at you and yelled at you to for not being able to build the lectern. since i was young, this really upset me, and asked my dad for help. he sat there for about 40 mnutes with the ii controller trying to help, but he never found the way to craft the lectern thingy from 4 apples, there was no crafting recipe at all for the lectern. i eventually quit and had a fit over it since i couldnt figure it out. i think this game was on some kind of wii or something, maybe an xbox, definetly some kind of console, anyways, Please tell me what this game is!",videogames,old video game. please help me identify it!

Is there any external HDD I should look into? As far as I know, 7200rpm is still the highest for HDDs. I'm not sure about SSDs.

(Reason: ""Dismissive behaviour in a sensitive thread), and ""After LOTR the Potter series is by far my favourite fantasy series. Can't wait for this! I really hope it's open world. Shame about the people working on this tho."" (Reason: Trolling and dog whistling about concerns of bigotry). Another user got banned for 5 days for simply saying ""They're so god damn hot"" in a thread discussing female appearance in games, for ""boy's club behavior"".

"Just as the title says, it doesn't matter if I play a multiplayer pvp game like League of legends or a story driven single player game like baldur's gate (those are just 2 of the many games I'm playing atm).

 I always end up trying to just play in a way that I find enjoyable but inevitably fall back into obsessivly looking up tier lists and power rankings and dismissing anything that isnt at the absolute top even if it greatly diminishes my enjoyment of the game. Especially single player games suffer from this because I just can not bring myself to finish them, I simply end up sucking the fun out of them and analyse how to powergame them more than I actually enjoy the story or gameplay. 

I simply can not seem to help it, I tend to feel like I am playing the game incorrectly or gimping myself by deliberately playing in a way that isnt optimal.

" So starting off, Skyward Sword HD was shown in the Nintendo Direct.  Unfortunately we did not get any Breath of the Wild 2 news, but when they announced “well we’ve been working on this game, and we hope you enjoy it,” I knew immediately that Skyward Sword was about to be revealed.  And 2 seconds later, Skyward Sword was being shown off for the Nintendo Switch in HD and 60 frames per second.  I will admit, I never gave Skyward Sword a chance on the Nintendo Wii, so I am excited for it to be released for the Switch. Also, when it comes to those joycons, I am going to buy them and probably never open them.

However, the main question people were asking was, “Where is the Zelda 35th collection, or where are the Twilight Princess HD and Wind Waker HD ports that were rumored?”

So to answer this question, I’m going to break it down into a couple of points for you everyone.  First off, just a reminder, take everything people say with a grain of salt.  These are just my speculations and the patterns that I have seen with Nintendo here recently. 

1. So starting off, one of the reasons we haven’t seen anything on the Zelda 35th collection is because we are still in the Mario 35th anniversary life cycle.  Mario’s 35th anniversary celebration does not end until March 31st of 2021, so we still have about a month and a half before we move on from Mario.  I have a hunch that Nintendo wants to keep the focus on Mario as of right now until we are clear from his anniversary.  Mario is an important franchise to Nintendo, and while Zelda is important as well, I feel that they don’t want to take away the spotlight from Mario.
2. When it comes to the rumored Zelda 35th collection, we need to realize that we still have the back half of 2021 for more releases.  This Nintendo Direct was primarily focused on the first half of 2021, with a couple of games that were announced for 2022.  I think we need to calm down with the “oh my gosh, Zelda is not going to get celebrated” talk for right now.  It is still way too early to decide whether or not Nintendo is not going to give the Zelda franchise the same treatment that the Mario franchise got in 2020.  So many people are jumping to all of these rash conclusions.  Just take a moment, breath, and it’s going to be okay.
3. When it comes to the rumored Twilight Princess HD &amp; Wind Waker HD ports that are being rumored for the Switch, I think that people need to calm down a little bit before making more rash conclusions that they are not coming to the Switch.  Again, this Direct was primarily focused on the first half of 2021.  Skyward Sword HD was a game that fell within that first half of the new year timeline.  More than likely, if a Twilight Princess HD and Wind Waker HD port are coming to the Switch, it is probably going to be in the later half of 2021.  Personally, if Breath of the Wild 2 is not released in 2021, I have a strong hunch that Nintendo will package Twilight Princess HD &amp; Wind Waker HD on to one cartridge and release that as their holiday game.  Or, there is a possibility that Nintendo releases Twilight Princess HD &amp; Wind Waker HD separately for full price, but let’s not dwell on that too much.  
   1. In fact, many gaming news outlets are still claiming that they know that it is 100% certain that Twilight Princess HD &amp; Wind Waker HD are still coming to the Switch.  How do they know that they are 100% accurate? Nobody knows, but only time will tell if these gaming news outlets are being honest with us gamers.  
   2. In essence, I think that Zelda fans do not need to be worried about Twilight Princess HD &amp; Wind Waker HD coming to the Switch. The main thing I am worried about is whether or not they are going to release these games separately for full price, or will they stick them on one Switch cartridge for full price.  It would be a classic Nintendo move to sell them separately for full price, because hey, nostalgia sells.

Overall Thoughts:

Overall, I am happy that Skyward Sword HD is coming to the Switch.  The joycons that are going to be released with the game are really nice, and I plan on picking them up if I can get my hands on them.  When it comes to games like Breath of the Wild 2, Zelda 35th anniversary, Twilight Princess HD, and Wind Waker HD, I think we need to take a step back and realize that we are still in the early stages of 2021.  Everything is going to be okay, and even if they don’t give us a 35th anniversary collection or Twilight Princess &amp; Wind Waker HD, Breath of the Wild 2 should be released sometime in the future, so that’s something to look forward to for Zelda fans.  But I am hoping that Ninetndo gives Zelda the same treatment that Mario got, because I 100% believe that Zelda deserves that type of treatment.",videogames,"Skyward Sword Announced for Switch, but Where Was Twilight Princess HD &amp; Wind Waker HD?"

"(spoilers for Journey) 

I guess I have been living under a rock but I am just now playing Journey in 2021. I went in completely blind, somehow avoiding any spoilers all of these years. 

I spent most of the game playing with a companion, singing with them, having them guide me through tricky moments in the caves, solving puzzles. Because I didn’t know anything about the game, I thought it was just like an NPC or something. I even journeyed and died with my companion on the mountain. So many times I thought to myself “this is what makes a journey, going on it with someone, shared experiences” and then of course at the end after viewing the beauty and the score of the game and the cathartic finale... I realize those companions were real people. I totally lost it. 

I don’t know if it’s because I have had a tough month, the isolation of the pandemic or just the realization itself,  but something about the fact that was a shared experience with another person just totally touched my soul. 

Anyway, I don’t have a lot of friends that play games or if they do they aren’t as emotional as me so I figured I would just post this and see if anyone can relate. I feel like I just had a beautiful experience and it reminded me of everything I love about video games and how it’s truly one of the best forms of art and entertainment. :,)",videogames,I just played Journey for the first time and I’m crying lol.

"I grew up a Nintendo kid and I really loved there games like everyone else so I'll skip all the personal stuff. What is going on with Nintendo right now. I swear every new release is a port of a game that came out on the last system, maybe they throw on a game from a different system or whatever but most of these games I feel like are games that most people won't want to play again. Fair enough they remade a link to the past from scratch but who seriously wants to play Mario kart 8 anymore. Nintendo is reselling the same games to us over and over again and they've barely released any new games worth mentioning. We got Odyssey, Botw (which is criminally overrated) and Pokémon Sword and Shield which were honestly a joke and I can't think of anything else that's memorable feel free to add your top picks. Now they're releasing directs full of games they ported over that no body asked for it just feels like they're not trying very hard or they're just out of touch and don't know what the fans want. The switch generation is the worst generation of nintendo imo cause there's just nothing to play (for long periods of time) I can't play elsewhere with better graphics.

"I’ve always been heavily in to video games, and I love nostalgia trips from games I used to play when I was really young. If ever I was randomly struck with a thought about a game I used to play, I would type in a description of the game into google or YouTube and I’d be able to find it. But, there’s one game I used to play on the school computers when I was in kindergarten, and I haven’t been able to find any information about it. I’ll describe it as best I can, but my memory is hazy (last time I played this game was over 10 years ago):

The game was 2-dimensional, and the aim of the game was to try and make it as far as you could from the starting point (kind of like jet pack joyride)

Your character was (if I remember correctly) a purple octopus with a pirate hat and black eyepatch (there may have been additional characters, but that’s the one I remember)

The game was centred around an ocean / beach theme (hence the octopus), and you would have to jump on small patches of sand and lily pads to avoid the water below you (if you touch the water, you died and would have to restart)

I think there may have been coins that you could collect, but I don’t remember properly

"I was born in 97 and remember playing on a computer while I was in elementary school so in the 2000's. There are three games in particular I'm looking for because I have kids and I want them to play them (I might also want to play them again)

So the first two I know for a fact were on a CD Rom, I'm not sure if they were seperate or on the same disc. 

The first of these two included a castle. Thats about all I got. It was cartoony, obviously. I think there was an NPC but I can't remember what it looked like whether it was a dragon or a knight but I think the object of the game was exploration and puzzle solving. 

The second was in a swamp and it was also puzzle solving but it did not look so cartoony and had very memorable music.

The third game was online and we played it in class. It was a game where you built these little monsters and tried to solve puzzles I think where you match them or destroy something to get them together. It was so long ago.

I understand the description of the first two are hard but maybe y'all can do varied searches and post in the comments.

" Hello all! We are here to announce the founding of (one of?) the first Roller Champions public league for all levels of skill to join. First of all, thank you for taking the time to read this post. Now let me explain our idea. We (me and my partners) have been in competitive gaming for a good while now and really like how Roller Champions is looking to turn out. We have experience competing in other leagues for various games and want to bring a safe, competitive, friendly, and overall fun league to everyone! There are still a lot of things in the works and a date for the first season has yet to be announced. If you think league-based gameplay with recurring seasons and playoffs with championships interests you for the upcoming free-to-play Roller Champions game then you have found the place to be! But for all of this to become a reality, we need YOUR help! Right now we know the game isn't released yet but would like to get ahead of the pitch by inviting anyone who is interested to [join our discord](https://discord.gg/fn5UaCN2DY) where updated will be posted and feedback from anyone can be provided (we are willing to hear out basically anything).

Some key things we would like to feature in the league once we get rolling:

* Team managers
* Conferences (Top contenders will meet in championships)
* Playoffs/Championships
* Player trading (from team to team)
* Various skill tiers &amp; potentially organizations for teams that spread throughout the skill tiers (for fair competing)
* Free agent trading/pick ups
* Roster slots
* Drafts (to select which players go on which teams)
* Contracts (ex. 2 seasons on a team before contract is needed to be resigned or player needs to be traded or let go)

These are some of the early stage ideas our teams has and is looking for way more.

Please, feel free to join our discord here: [https://discord.gg/fn5UaCN2DY](https://discord.gg/fn5UaCN2DY)

The only way this is going to work is if we can bring the strong communities of competitive gameplay and Roller Champions together in this league and create a professional gaming environment.

"If Ori and the Willow Wisps is a visually breathtaking and calm update on Metroid, Moss VR is Zelda as a little, adorable mouse in a beautiful puzzle forest. I absolutely love all these peaceful narrative indie games. I \*JUST\* started Return of the Obra Dinn... it's my JAMMY. It's a pretty amazing time for creativity in indie games, and it's sort of a medicated balm to the absolute endless chaos of open world RPG, etc.

I'm not sure how popular it is, but 5-year-old Firewatch is a narrative story ""choose your own adventure"" ""walking simulator"". It was a wonderful and chill departure during the pandemic (I'm sort of new to gaming and catching up!).  Even for non-gamers who just want to chill and look at pretty stuff, it's something to check out.

But this quick read article about the nuances of choices in video game design is really great, and ""being too smart for your own good"" was interesting. I know the beginning of Firewatch is mapping out the story and might not be as consequential, but the idea the game was that thoughtful in your choices, and allowing you autonomy vs making it obvious, is interesting enough to play the game again. I had thought it was more linear than it was.

So it's a quick read/interview, but thought some of you might enjoy:

Here's a 10min video of the intro, if you need some idea of what the game is about. The start of the game has story cards where you choose things, but fast forward to the end to see proper gameplay:

"LOL this is a dumb question, so I’m already prepared for the insults.

I understand that “FPS” means “first person shooter”.

But what is the position of the camera really trying to capture? 

Let’s use halo and call of duty for example. When playing those games , are you seeing exactly what the video game character is seeing? In other words, is the camera the eyes of the video game character?

OR , is the camera positioned right around their chest level? therefore; when you ADS (Aim down sights); that’s when the video game character is placing the weapon at eye level; which would explain why the gun goes the the center of the screen and zooms closer in (call of duty).

IMO , I think the camera is pretty much just the eyes of the video game character. But I just feel like since it’s a game, they can’t make the gun positioned too low when hip firing LOL.

"  So I'm currently playing though Assassin's Creed Syndicate, one of the very few in the series I haven't played. So I started thinking about the main differences between these types of AC and the newer ones (not playing ragnarok till I get me that PS5 lol) I didnt really enjoy origins and oddesey was okay, but after going back to some of the older games I REALLY miss this linearity. When sync points meant more than just how far your eagle can scan. And when fighting felt good, when I activly saught out combat instead of groaning when I saw a hoard of enemy's coming my way. Watching the same animations as I slashed at a single enemy for way to long. I enjoy the whole rpg aspect, cause I'll agree it's a fresh take on the series.

  Everytime I boot up oddesey, and hop on my ship it really just makes me play black flag. Everytime I look though my inventory and look at my weapons it just makes me wanna play AC3. And what's the deal with the whole non assassination assassinations? As a child nothing made me feel more badass then perching on a flagpole, jumping off of it and plunging my wrist blade into the back of some unsuspecting templar. But now unless I put resources and a boat load of coin into upgrading this historic weapon, I simply tickle the damn guy with it. 

  This style of rpg really makes me fear the future of video games, I was SO excited for the Avengers game, but when I got it I realized it's exactly the game I hate. Spending more time with these rpg aspects and getting the good gear to make you a competitor agianst these leveled damage sponges. So instead of making you feel like an assassin, or an avenger you feel more like a person with a controller spamming the same 2 or 3 buttons waiting for the healthbars to tick down until you get one of 3 killing animations to go off. 

   Agian, I've never played the new AC nor have I seen any content or gameplay to do with it. So I really hope it isn't like the other two ""Revamped"" rpg Assassin's Creed so if it's not like this then great.. but I really just wanna know if there are other people in the community who feel the same way I do. 

  happy gaming everyone!",videogames,Anyone else miss the old style of Assassin's Creed?

Also i havent played enough games to know what genres I like (ive only played one or two games of each genre and so far I liked them all so idk what genres i like the most yet) so the logic of ""you should only grab games if you like that genre"" doesnt work either.

It seems like everything is either a 10 or a zero, and if you're lucky then they'll have a description or explanation, but 90% of the time there's no justification or it's pitifully poorly written. Games have so many pieces that justify nuanced or middling scores, which makes no sense because they have visuals *and* gameplay *and* story *and* soundtrack and a million other things.

I can't even use the ""professional"" reviews, which seem to range from 7/10 - 8/10 and have the benefit of better grammer and less random bullshit, but seem to be nothing but empty words for a paycheck.

I’ve had a lot of free time with college being all online so I decided you know what why not ask her if she’s hiring. After paying I approached her regarding employment. We had a chat and I filled out some stuff and surprisingly I was hired on the spot! I started the next day. My first day went pretty well aside from your typical rude old ladies. I got into a conversation with my boss and it turns out she had a boyfriend. “Alas, the dream is dead” I thought. Time goes on and I learn from a coworker that her boyfriend and her broke up. Taking advantage of this opportunity, I asked her out right after work. She declined my offer saying I wasn’t her type. I went home disappointed. But as I was at home contemplating life in the shower I thought “I can make myself her type!” I began to change myself, I started to act more confident and hit the gym. Couple months later, I start to notice she’s acting different around me. I decide that it’s now or never. I asked her out right on the middle of work. She said yes. Many places were closed because of covid, but that weekend we went to chili’s. It was a fun night. I heard from coworkers that she was incredibly happy the next day at work. We go on a couple more dates when she hits me with the question, “can I come to your place?” Oh shit. Of course I say yes. She comes over after work a couple of days later. I prepare us a nice romantic meal. After eating we snuggled on the couch before she leaned over to me and whispered in my ear “I wanna go to your bedroom.” We did some things that I assume I’m not allowed to talk about on this sub.  After an amazing experience we lay in my bed in awe. Eventually she suggests watching Netflix. I point her to the remote and she picks it up. She turns on the tv. “What’s this on the TV?” she says. I look up, and it’s Sonic 06 and it’s still fucking loading.",videogames,Sonic 06’s loading times are so fucking long

"The Demon Slayer video game is a 3D arena fighter and immediately I lost all interest in it. I'm sure it will be fine, but I simply looked at the gameplay reveal and sighed before moving on

For those not in the no, arena battlers are 3D fighting games with full control over the movement of your character rather than being stuck facing your opponent. Usually these are in tight, enclosed round spaces think the difference between Soul Calibur and Naruto Ninja Storm. This genre isn't inherently bad, but it feels like every single shounen anime has been turned into one, and nearly all of them are forgotten within a year that they come out.

Demon Slayer is the story of Tanjiro, who, after his family slain by demons and his little sister turned into one, becomes a Demon Slayerto try and find a way to cure his sister. A large focus of the story is on contrasting Tanjiro with others of his kind as he is hugely empathetic not just to his friends but to his foes. he understands that being a demon is suffering, praying for their very Souls after every kill. Even the ones who are simply pure evil.

The story also takes place in Taisho period of Japan. Well there's a lot to say about the rise of the Japanese diet and the democratization of the country, it also lets you an interesting contrast between the increasingly Urban areas of Japan and the still very rural parts of the country where Tanjiro is from. the story shows his first time encountering things like electric lights, major cities, ""modern"" fashion. Imagine a game where you get to explore this unique period in Japanese history, the end of what people would call old japan, the rapid urbanization of the country. Imagine exploring the themes present in Demon Slayer of empathy, how it's one of the most powerful tools a person can have and the reason tanjiro is so successful. Imagine a fun and unique combat system revolving around the different breaths that he can perform. 

Or we can just shove all the characters in a locked room and have them kill each other in a boring but pretty button masher.

Like I said these games usually aren't bad, though jump force was pretty dismal. It couldn't even get the boring part of boring but pretty right. But it feels like every property under the sun gets turned into one that feels and plays exactly the same. 

 How can we make a Demon Slayer game? I see two options. either you play as just tanjiro, exploring the countryside with nezuko and occasionally running into characters that he has traveled with. You have various quests for people in the region, hunt demons, and explore unique storyline. Ghost of tsushima, while I wasn't the biggest fan of, does serve as a great basis. Maybe a little less assassin's Creed in terms of its gameplay loop.

Or you havedemon slayer as a jrpg with a full party. You could still have a focus on exploration and those side quests but instead it's something closer to, say, Dragon Quest or even Xenoblade. you can have a lot of unique character interactions that you wouldn't get in the anime or manga, you could have explorations of characters that don't appear as often. 

Both of those would be so cool! I'd play the hell out of them. But instead we're getting another ultimate Ninja Storm clone. Like My Hero One's Justice. Or One Punch Man. Or Kill la Kill IF. Or Jump Force. Or Seven Deadly Sins: Knights of Britannia. Or what I'm sure will be another dozen different anime fighters until the end of God damn time.",videogames,I'm sick of great anime getting turned into generic arena battlers (rant)

"In 2010 it has been reported that a **14-year-old Russian boy has killed his father because of a video game**. His mother was unharmed and later had explained what happened to the police. The boy has been playing video games on his computer for weeks and his parents decided to take his keyboard away so he cannot interact with the computer, the boy then decided to attack his father in the middle of the night using a sledgehammer killing him on the spot. The mother had given the keyboard back to her son after the killing and he continued to play video games for several hours before falling asleep. From an ethical viewpoint if we take the deontological theory we can say that it is affected as killing another human being is not ethical however there are rumors that the father of the child had beaten the child mercilessness for weeks before taking his keyboard away in that perspective the sons actions are somewhat justified as long as the consequences are not considered.

Most video games go like this.  If you have amazing graphics you will have less gameplay opportunities IE: Items, Maps, Props etc etc....

This is due to the fact that you can only shove so much into a game before you hit the limits of modern consoles and the average gaming pc of current times

I am aware that PC only games don't suffer from this as much due to the fact that you can have a huge amount of space on a gaming PC compared to the current gen consoles.

In this gamers opinion, I would rather have 2008-2010 style graphics and have way more Gameplay then have crazy amazing graphics with no gameplay.",videogames,Decided to put my OPINION! in chart form.

"I’ve been thoroughly enjoying the THPS 1+2 recently. I’m anxiously awaiting an announcement for 3+4, which seems like a natural assumption to make. 

I never actually played thps in my childhood except for a bit of 4. By the time I was into video games, I was deep into American Wasteland. I have a huge amount of nostalgia for the game and I watched a couple playthroughs recently on YouTube.

My thoughts is that this game would be a perfect candidate for a reboot. A good analogy would be the new Modern Warfare game; a new interpretation of the original concept and story.

I think the concept behind American Wasteland is great. It is a simple story where a nobody moves to LA and becomes a good skateboarder. He befriends a ragtag group of skaters and they start to vandalize the city in order to collect scrap for their own personal skate park. There’s some drama in the end about how the park’s owner Iggy doesn’t actually own the park and the gang makes enough money to buy it.

There are several parts of this game that are good, but could be better. (Insert WW84 meme here)

1. The graphical and system improvements of the current systems would help a lot. The game is completely open world and it was a bit too ahead of its time. It had long hallways between areas to facilitate the map loading. A reboot could have a larger and more connected map. 

2. The skate park needs to be grander and more customizable. With fewer system restrictions, the main skate park should have much more interesting components. It should also be somewhat customizable with different parts that can be added. Not like create-a-park, but just a “do you want a pool here or a halfpipe? This would add a lot of replayability.

3. The acting and story should be improved. The main story was goofy and often floated into so-bad-it’s-good, but it was still bad. I’d like a more fleshed out story with components about your rise to skater fame and the park creation.

What do you think? Is there anything else a reboot should have? Are there any other games that need a similar reboot?",videogames,Tony Hawk’s American Wasteland is a perfect candidate for a hard remaster/reboot.

"Please help me find this game using only my memory! I will gladly appreciate it! :) I remember when I was 10-ish or 12 I was playing this game. It's pretty old from the 2000s since I am born in 2003, I feel like this game existed from 2011 to 2012. I really want to play this game again to remember old memories from the good times when I was a kid. This game as far as I can remember is a hidden objects game with amazing graphics and art. It was amazing. Unlike typical hidden objects game, I don't remember if it actually shows you the items that you need to find. Unlike other hidden objects game, this game actually has its objects on why you should find the items... to brew and make concoctions of potions. I remember the potions actually has purposes that are used. The world of this video games is so magical, fantasy, and out of this world, with no modern twist at all. It's like you're at Alice in Wonderland. It has Goblins and other creatures that I remember that I did use potions on (I think it has frogs too?). The items are weird... very weird... it's used to make concoctions from weird resources. There's this one challenge where I have to find the items and use a potion so the giant frog or creature doesn't wake up. I don't really remember this game and I am not sure if it even a hidden objects game but this are the characteristics that I can remember so far,

&amp;#x200B;

\- You have to find specific items to brew or make concoctions of potions using your mouse and clicking it. 

 \- The items, as far as I can remember are Mortar and Pestle, herbs any other un-earthly materials.

\- There are creatures such as goblins and trees with faces (?), that are part of the challenges 

\- It looks like an alive in wonderland type of aesthetic but even more highly detailed with high graphics, but it did not have animations, only a few because it was so highly detailed 

\- It may have existed from the 2000s 

\- I feel like the mortar and pestle is part of the game itself, I use to remember that some of the items are used to crush it in the mortar and pestle. 

&amp;#x200B;

That is far as I can remember because I was a kid back then and I don't remember this game specifically, that's why I really need your help gamers! Just for the nostalgia factor, you know what I mean? I remember playing this on my laptop. It's not a typical mainstream game, it's a game meant for kids but very interesting and alluring.  Please help! 

&amp;#x200B;

Below are the pictures that I think looks familiar to the game I am trying to find, but it is not it. The items are mostly blended into the background unlike the pictures which it is most likely from another game, have more of a cluttered look. The game is mostly like Alice in Wonderland, focusing on scenes like nature, trees, cottages, brewing and more. This game was very odd, to me now because I have long forgotten about it, but when I was a kid I didn't mind it. 

If someone actually found this game for me, I will put their name up in this section and I will be thanking them! But reading this post and using your time is really great help too! I just really want to know about this game again, help a gamer out. :)

"So I'm a big fan of stealth, fast kill times, tactics and realism (to a degree) and am looking for a new game to play. I am a casual person though so I don't like games that you have to sink a whole day into to really play.

(I play on PC)

&amp;#x200B;

Stealth: 

I was looking at buying Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts (very long name) but I really don't like games where the silenced weapons have magic suppressors that make your gun completely silent from 2 feet away and you can just crouch in a small, scraggly bush and suddenly ""disappear"". 

Tom Clancy seems to have a few good stealth games like Ghost Recon Wildlands and Splintercell but as previously mentioned I'm afraid that they suffer from the whole ""magical silencers"" and ""I have dropped down 2 inches and in some low grass, I am now invisible"" problems.

I bought Hitman 2016 about a year ago and it was amazing and one of the most fun games I have ever played even with its ""magic suppressors"".

&amp;#x200B;

Realism, Tactics and Fast time to kill

I really like the quick death time and realism of Escape From Tarkov however, the large price tag is very offputting for me. It looks like a very fun game with a good amount of realism but you have to pay $100.00 if you actually want a good start which seems like a lot to me.

Squad and Arma III look really frustrating with you seemingly walking around for 15 minutes just to get one-shot by a sniper you never saw. The insane realism is also very off-putting, and I don't think they would be very fun for a more casual person such as myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I know this is a very big favour to ask but if anyone knows of any games that fit some of those criteria or have played games such as Splintercell, Ghost Recon Wildlands, or Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts and think that I should give them, I would really appreciate suggestions and recommendations.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance.",videogames,"What games should I get? (Tactical, Stealthy, Fast time to kill)"

"Hi all!

I remember seeing a gameplay video on youtube a while back, narrated by a philosopher, and the game was a blocky kind of micro and macro tyoe thing.

In the gameplay the player is grass, moving around a field, but then clicks on a ladybug and plays as a ladybug for a while, then a bear, then an island, then a planet in thr universe.

Thr game is low poly and low quality animations but you can be anything at all in a micro or macro view.

For the record, DE1 could be rendered in 3D with DX10. Another example I'm NOT talking about is ""Bioshock 1"", because it's heavily scripted, so much so that apparently fans debate whether it's a 1st-person-shooter.

"Hi all, thanks for responding to my [Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/videogames/comments/la5o10/what_game_to_get_my_mom_into/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) about this! I wanted to share some input from my mom/clarify some things. 

Correcting Old Information:

1. Can’t believe I forgot to mention the fact my mom used to go to arcades all the time (she was in her teens during the 80’s). In fact one of her favorite videogames is the original Doom and she was sad to learn the new Dooms aren’t like the classic.

2. Should have mentioned my Mom’s job involves her being on her computer all the time so she’s not a caveman boomer.

3. My Mom is a very linear thinker thus why she hates sandbox games/games with no clear direction.

3. Finally I forgot to mention both her main desktop and laptop are Apple from a few years ago (not ancient just not new).

New Information:

So my mom has provided some further information when I explained to her what I was trying to do:

1. She said the only reason she plays so many bejeweled-esq games on her phone is simply because she can play them for a few minutes while waiting for things. Aka the game does not have to be a puzzle game and that leads into my second point:

2. As mentioned in my last post she played the hell out of first edition dungeons and dragons and will still nerd out any time I talk about it or show her a video relating to it. This is to say her favorite genre by far are RPGs.

3. She said that in general, real time combat stresses her out so she much rather prefers turn based combat

4. I told her briefly about Portal which she said “Thats the one where you go through circles right?” She is hesitant to try it because on paper with a two second description it sounds pretty out there, but I will be showing her some clips and what no so I’ll update then.

5. Sorry to the Pokemon fans (myself included) but she’s said she has basically no interest in the series. I might be able to sway her to try them.


Anyway that’s the update! Sorry for the big chunk of text! Thank you to all the people who commented last time, have a great day! -Juice

"Now I might be wrong and this might not be true, but corporations, companies, and businesses are going to be more in control and become more rich and more profitable in the next 10 years. I'm only 15, and I know this. Money is really valuable, and people get really greedy because of it, its just fact. Used-to-be reliable companies, such as Ubisoft, CD Projekt Red, and Bethesda have gone so downhill, with Ubisoft getting ridden with microtransactions and bad game decisions, CD Projekt Red becoming corrupt and making bad business choices, and Bethesda being Bethesda of course (although they have been bought by Microsoft I believe so that might be interesting). Even the greats, like Rockstar and Nintendo are starting to decline with the greed of microtransactions and just making boring games. Although I believe Rockstar will probably still make some good games for a good amount of time. But the undeniable truth is that games have gotten so much worse over time. Sure, we have had many good games, and I think we will always have indie developers that can make amazing games. But those game companies are going to slowly go downhill. Greed can really take over people and in this case, videogames have just lowered in quality. Its sad but I think a lot of series that we have loved and cared for will die. My theories?

Halo

Assassins Creed

Call of Duty

Fallout

Pokémon

Half Life

Any superhero games that are NOT made my Insomniac

Street Fighter

Yakuza

The Last of Us

The Sims

Battlefield

Now I might be wrong but some of the best games of the 2020's will most likely be games in new series. Out favorites will still be made, but they will die quickly, and won't be as popular. Its sad in some ways but its also a exciting thing since we are going to have so many interesting games. I personally am looking forward to the new Elder Scrolls, as well as the new Spiderman by Insomniac.

Now you might disagree with me, and thats fine. I really honestly hope that I'm wrong in some ways. It just doesn't seem like its going to play that way. Indie developers will most likely be the new developers of most games to the general public. Big tech companies and providers like Microsoft, Nintendo, PlayStation, ect. They will still be rich with games so we don't have to worry about that. VR will be popular I'm sure but I have a feeling that the big companies will take advantage as they are expensive and indie people will have harder times using them. Tech will get better, but (and I am 99% sure this will trigger some), PC's will die in the next 15-20 years as gaming platforms and things like cloud gaming will most definitely grow as a viable gaming platform. Things like Shadow and Stadia will surely grow, and will be much cheaper that really big expensive gaming PC's. I think the 2020's will be a very generation changing decade for gaming. It will be exciting but it will really different. Companies will die, like Bethesda, and companies will grow, like Insomniac. I have faith that games will continue to be good, just different.

I only phrased it like they will go further downhill because it will do further from the games that we enjoy. Maybe for some it will be downhill, nothing will be quite like playing Dark Souls 1 for the first time, or finishing Red Dead Redemption 2.

But maybe it can be better. At the very least, really fun.

What she's looking for: A game involving a lot of chill world exploration, maybe with shaping/building/gathering elements. She gave Don't Starve as a decent example of what she's looking for, but ideally even more to explore than that. Also 3rd person. 

That's the main thing. Bonus points if it's chill and relaxing and things make a little popping sound effect when you dig/pull them up, but that's obviously(?) not mandatory :)

I hardly remember much about the story but i do remember one specific thing about it; through different story options you can get stuck on a island and have the artistic style of the game change completely once it happens.

you go to this island either to find something on it in a cave; but i'm pretty sure what happened is they get shipwrecked on the island and got to try to survive until they can escape. it goes to a point after you do the mini games on the island which was harvesting some food, killing some creature and going to a cave for some reason and one of the character who is a humanoid cat (i just remember him having a cats head) will ask if they should even keep trying. you can choose to stop trying to leave the island and that is when the games art style changes to a Sepia color template, all the portraits becoming all sketched and all i remember being able to do at that point was do those mini games day end day out. i ended up not saving and going back to choose the other option and we got off the island but i cannot for the life of me remember anything else. if sure someone else out there has played this game and might remember this and might even remember the name so if you might know please let me know!

"I just watched one of Star Citizens latest videos on Character Design and this fact hit me. Obviously there has been a big debate about quality of video games with the launch of Cyberpunk. My standpoint since a few years has been the same regarding this topic: You can't make a gem of a Triple A title within a few years (Expansions excluded).  


Star Citizen might not yet be released, but the transparency with their work is groundbreaking and eye opening for me. It shows me how much time and manpower is spent on proper development. It would be naive to believe they did nothing but train hair design for the whole time, so take this information with a grain of salt.

  
Anyway, I hope we're all shifting towards a more relaxed stand on development time, especially the investors that will benefit from this aswell.

"Hello people of reddit, I have a serious question for you guys which comes in two parts.

Part1: How do you know when a person is better than you on a certain game. What do you base it off of? How well either one of you does in public matches within a given time frame, the amount of 1v1’s won between either one of you, what factors do you take into account or do you think SHOULD be taken into account before deciding who is better than the other at a certain game.

Part2: When speaking in terms of competitive gaming, who would you agree has a better understanding: Gamer A who primarily focuses on playing sports games or Gamer B who not only has attended tournaments, but has also a diverse gaming genre.

"I have been searching for this internet game for around a year now which I used to play as a kid, around 2010-2015. It was on a website similar to [www.crazygames.com](https://www.crazygames.com). All I remember was that there was a whack-a-mole similar type minigame within, as well as a circus type setting. I also recall one setting where there is a tall signpost with directional arrows, with triangular flags hanging from the top of the screen. This is a horrible description, although this game is locked inside my head, I somehow can't remember anything. Hopefully someone understands.",videogames,HELP me find this old game!

"Superliminal scratched a weird emotional itch for me, but I want to stock up with alternatives when I get that itch again. I'd say it's the feeling of soothing isolation. You know from beginning to end that you're all alone, but rather than being scary, it's all very serene and calming, like you know that you have this beautiful scenery all to yourself, and you're working on your own time and nobody else's.&gt;! Of course, I'm, disregarding the one chapter of the story that deliberately does the exact opposite, but that's besides the point.!&lt;

Do any other games come to mind that evoke that kind of soothing atmosphere? I actually get a similar feeling from Minecraft with shaders on, so that's one option for me.

I also get a similarly calm feeling from the first Pikmin game, but that's pretty much the polar opposite of ""safe and alone"", so I don't really know how to explain that one. Maybe I'm just looking for a game that will let me enjoy the beautiful scenery at my own pace.",videogames,Games with a similar feel to Superliminal?

"Okay I don't really know how to articulate my thoughts but I'm going to try my best and thanks for taking the time to look at this post!

I have recently found myself really into a certain type of gameplay mechanic, and it's the idea of having a lot of unique unlockable characters and least that is what I THINK is pulling me in. Let me try and give some examples of games I'm playing:

Dead By Daylight: I love the feeling of having all these unique killers to unlock and play, they each have their own individual progression and leveling system to make them stronger and show others your skill with them.

MOBAs: TONS of characters to grind for and some like Smite, each character has a mastery level to increase the more you play them and the better you get at them.

Fighters: Very into the idea of each Fighting Game having multiple characters to play that have all their own combos and special abilities to learn and master, good example is Tekken which give you the opportunity to rank up with each fighter, mostly online. 

Bonus Example: a little bit different than the previous but mount and transmog collecting in WOW scratches a tiny bit of whatever itch this is.

So in summery I can't pinpoint exactly what this itch is but I want more, so if there is ANY game suggestions or anyone that has experienced this same thing please share! I really really appreciate it 🙏",videogames,Need Suggestions

It's a game where you start with pretty much nothing, then as you progress you level up. Every time you level up it give you a pop-up with two or three different choices of upgrades/abilities. This continues until I think level 10, and the abilities get progressively stronger, with the strongest abilities at max kevel. Then when you die, you start over again from base level and do it again with different upgrades. It's RNG. It's very similar to Hades, but I know it's not Hades because instead of clearing a floor to get your upgrades, it was based off of a level system.

"So for those of you who aren't old enough to remember this. Fallout New Vegas had an incredibly similar rollout to Cyberpunk 2077. It was an incredibly ambitious game for it's era. A game that was released in a very incomplete state. There were so many game breaking bugs that made the game virtually unplayable. I personally had a glitch where the vendors would never refresh their ammo inventory. Meaning that roughly by the time I got to the Strip. I was desperately running out of ammo and had very few ways of restoring it. None of which were sufficient enough to allow my playthrough to continue. I didn't beat the game until 5 years later after it had been fixed and the bad taste had left my mouth. It's also worth noting this wasn't remotely as bad as some people had it. Several main quests on PC would simply crash your computer.

What this lead to were consistent reviews saying ""there was a great game under all the bugs and it was a shame that it didn't have more time to be polished"". Reviewers consistently rated this game in the high 70s or low 80s. Cyberpunk 2077 in 2021 faces a similar situation. We all know there is an incredible game under the bugs and hardware not quite powerful enough for the game. However, the game for many is simply unplayable because of these technical issues but with time this will change.

We know that the patching of this will continue. We know that eventually most people will shift over to more recent generation consoles and with that most of the main games problems will be solved. We also know that DLC of similar story/world quality will probably come to us. What this leads me to believe is that the jewel of a game under all these technical issues will eventually emerge. People who didn't play the game initially will pick it up a year from now when most of these issues have been resolved. Then eventually people stung by the game's initial run will give it a second try and be pleasantly surprised by the game's improvement. Then as with most classic games, 10-15 years from now nostalgia will set in. The rocky launch will be remembered as a hiccup. Doubtlessly overshadowed by more recent awful launches. Idk if Cyberpunk 2077 will be remembered as the game of a generation but it certainly has that potential once all it's issues are resolved.",videogames,Unpopular Opinion. Cyberpunk 2077 will be viewed in the same light as Fallout New Vegas in 10-15 years

"I recently remembered an old game I remember seeing Markiplier play like 3-4 years ago. It might have been a web browser or [ITCH.IO](https://ITCH.IO) game but I'm not sure. I recall remembering about it like 2 years ago (some of my first posts on Reddit were asking about the game) and whenever the game pops up in my mind I just get so annoyed that I can't find it anywhere! Markiplier might have included it in his creepy/weird playlists, but skimming through most of them I didn't recognize any videos to be of him playing the game I'm thinking of. anyways, here's a description I made of the game a while ago before my memory got fuzzy about it:

I remember this game being very simple, a black screen, and it would start when green pixel text would appear.

While the text appeared, numbers would appear at the bottom of the screen and a man with a computer-ish voice would read what the text says. It wasn't complete gibberish, but the sentence he read made no sense at all. I faintly recall him mentioning a table cloth and a door but take that with a grain of salt.

Anyways, once the text ended and the voice stopped speaking, the numbers that appeared at the bottom would be finished generating, with a ""Game over"" or a ""You win"" text, I don't recall which one though.

Each time you would re-play the game, the numbers would be random and the text would stay the same. I remember when I first saw Markiplier play this I was interested, and some other lesser known YouTuber did a video going through the possible meanings of the game. I remember he ended up going to a website where it had you close your eyes and a narrator would make you envision things. The game seemed to have had some mystery to it but nothing would happen in the game itself.

I've been really curious about what this game's name is, and or if someone can find me the Markiplier video he did of him playing it! Thanks a million!

"About me. I have worked San Francisco with video game companies since 2008. I started with Lucas arts. I was on the 1st force unbleached.

Since then I have been with the defunct ngmoco Zynga ubisoft and more. I don't know everything. But I can tell you what I think from what I have seen. Take it how you want. I mentioned these games and companies not just to give myself some credit but to also mention the absolute tragedy it has been to see so many good ideas be cut from games. The problem is not the creativity, it is the development process in America.
If we really want to save gaming, we should outsource the entire process overseas. Nothing should be done here, even localization. The management here cares more about budgets and their careers than games. They will strip a game down to be unplayable if it means that they look good on paper and can say they saved money.
Remember America started video games with atari and ruined the industry until Nintendo revived it and history will so repeat itself unless we learn from the past and take action. The staff in these projects is waaaay to overpaid and that also hurts the development process. Someone building an environment on a mobile game should not be making 6 digits. Even on a second tier console game. Producers making 300k when people can make video games on their own now is very unnecessary. We pay for all this shit. People go from company to company, hiring their buddies and then half assing the job. This cronyism is the number 1 reason why so many games suck. Japan hires their workers for life. They can focus on improving their skills and doing their best with a sense of loyalty. Here workers already know they will be shit canned when the project ends. Would you spend all your time doing your best there? Or  would you spend some of that time looking for work to do after the project ends? Of course not. We need to cut literally every game development and production job here and ship their jobs overseas because they deserve it for shipping so many incomplete games.",videogames,The only way to fix gaming

"Anybody who's ever served in the military, police, or hunting probably doesn't like how unrealistic all these shooter games seem to be. but don't get me wrong I play call of duty and I've played battlefield and I switch between the two on occasion but I have to go long periods of time without doing either because I cannot stand how unrealistic they are.

Let's start with the basics of things that have been wrong or ignored in both games.

-uniforms. Even in world war II if you were out of uniform especially in a combat zone you could be executed for being a spy and it happened on occasion. Uniforms help tell you who's on your side and who isn't. You want realism don't put a floating glowing name above someone's head or anything like that. One side has matching uniforms that match specific way the other side have matching uniforms that match a different way. 

-weapon uniformity. some weapon uniformity exists for practical reasons like Mass manufacturing; supply and resupply; in the case of special units specific to mission.

-weapon damage. The basic handheld weapons that you carry should all have the same damage scale with 100 being the most in this category.

-weapon penetration. Not all weapons can shoot easily through a piece of plywood not all weapons can easily be stopped by a block of concrete either. Weapon with the most armor piercing potential should be at 100 and if all of them are rated on the same scale not 100 for pistols 100 for this 100 for that it makes it easier to gauge which weapons better for the person who's going to be carrying it.

-Weapon range.
This should be measured in actual yards and meters.

-Weapon accuracy. once again I believe should be rated out of a scale of a hundred even though you're not doing it as a percentage because obviously everything has a chance to miss even if it is the most accurate weapon in the world s*** happens. but have the most accurate weapon be a hundred this is the most accurate and everything else scale back.if weapons are rated at the same accuracy damage and everything then they should be rated at the same number not deciding this one's better because you like it more.

-rate of fire in rounds per minute. now this number should be based on how fast it could fire if it say you had an unlimited size magazine and never had to reload how many rounds you could fire out of it in a minute.

-Magazine size.
How many bullets it carries in a standard magazine. How many bullets it may carry if it had an extended magazine.

-Recoil &amp; Muzzle climb.
Now if you're not familiar with what recoil and muscle climb are the best way for you to learn about this is honestly to go fire a 12 gauge Mossberg shotgun. recommend someone teaching you how to do it first well you'll learn the hard way how bad the recoil on that is. However there is next to zero recoil on something like an M16. But as far as I can tell all weapons have something called muzzle climb. Maybe artillery doesn't but artillery is mounted and sometimes the whole Mount moves when it fires so they have other issues. This article is mainly about the functionality of handheld weapons.

Furthermore I would like to see you a game where they take into consideration animals are not immune to bullets animals are not bulletproof animals don't like to run towards bullets. Period. 

I'd like to see the basic combat not ignore damage to one's body. Maybe you could put into a way into the game away to be you know resurrected and explain the whole respawn thing but the basics of combat is you shoot something it dies for the most part. make it so if you shoot them in the head they don't get a reply but if we both pull the trigger at the same time both bullets have to be taken into consideration because both are already in flight doesn't matter whose gets there first both are already in flight both outcomes have to be resolved. 

Don't put into play things like juggernauts. There is no Almighty bulletproof suit and even if there was some of the impacts from certain bullets even if it just hit the armor on the outside would still rupture internal organs killing you relatively instantaneously if it was hit with a large enough round or the exposure of an RPG right nearby Juggernaut isn't impossibility as is iron Man who's a juggernaut with rockets engines on his feet and hands.when you're trying to build a realistic game your sci-fi s*** doesn't need to be there. It's hard enough to portray the realism the extra s***'s not needed.the cold blooded perk from call of duty being invisible to thermal not possible at least as far as I know aside from being in certain thick buildings thinner buildings we can actually see the thermal image through the wall. Basic research on that might be key to making it a little bit more realistic. Certain thermal cameras can't be used in the daytime cuz they would burn out that doesn't mean you can't make it so that they're able to be used at night time. Speak to a few spec warfare operators and basic infantry he might get some helpful information on how things are.you can still have it be a random free-for-all or a team paintball kind of match if you so desire but I think you'll find that most people are like this is nothing like at all anything military oriented no matter how much you try it will never be able to be 100%. Most civilians don't want to stand rear guard watch especially if they know their friend three feet to their left is engaging an enemy. But if you can fix like the realism when it comes to how the guns function that might make it a little bit more enjoyable for those of us that understand how these things work. And I understand only 1% of the US population has served or is serving active duty in the US military but that's still 1% of several million people a good chunk of which like to play these kind of games.making it more enjoyable when that's a good chunk of the population that and that's a good chunk of the population with which plays your game might be helpful.",videogames,It would be nice to have a realistic first person shooter game.

"Unless it's named Pokemon or Paper Mario (and even then, only the first two on the N64 and Gamecube), I can't seem to get around to finishing an RPG game.

It's not that I hate the games or anything.  I just never get around to it again after I save and put it down.  And sometimes, I don't remember what I was doing if I do pick it up again.

The ones mentioned above are supposed to be introductions to the genre, basically ""Baby's first RPG"".  And we're supposed to move on to the ones that have things like a better story, better graphics, maybe some new mechanics to play around with, etc.  But that really doesn't happen with me.

And I tried all kinds.  Golden Sun,all the English Fire Emblems, various Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy, Bravely Default, Earthbound, dabbled in the Mana series, Dragon Age, and others I'm possibly forgetting.

I guess the time sink may be a factor, but Pokemon and Paper Mario can be a time sink too, and I at least finish the story of those games.

"Hey /r/videogames. I've got a bit of a broad question: what are some PC games you know that feature interesting architecture?

The reason I'm asking is that I'm an artist who does a lot of work that intersects with architecture and design. A project that I wish to start involves video games. I want to utilize digital worlds and the architecture they feature as a source for paintings and sculptures. I've got a number of old games I used to play to check out, but I'd love to find some more.

So that's where I hope you can help. What are some PC games you know that feature interesting architecture? It can be anything at all, so long as there are buildings in the world that you find interesting. It doesn't matter if they're realistic or pure fantasy, bleak/dark or bright/fun, brand new or in ruins etc. As long as you think it's interesting or memorable, I'd like to check it out.

I'd prefer PC only and ideally no games made after about 2015, since I'll be using a very ancient system to check these out (Core2 Quad Q6600, 8GB DDR2, GTX 750 Ti). I am open to older console games made from the PS1/2/Xbox era since I can probably emulate those, but PC games are probably the easiest.

Any and all suggestions would be great.",videogames,What PC games feature interesting architecture to you?
"Hello everyone! First I’d like to appreciate the time you take to read my post,I understand time is valuable so thanks! Anyways I had an idea for a video game that would be set in Norse mythology. I understand games like God of War and AC Valhalla exist but I believe I have a good idea for this type of game.You would play as a young Viking child who is said to be the one to stop Ragnarok according to the clans fortune teller.He begins training from a young age on a sacred mountain inhabited by Thor.Thor reluctant at first decides to train and take after the young boy.One day after training the boy (around 17 or 19 now) comes back to find Thors dead body and with a large gash wound caused from the dragon that is said to trigger Ragnarok,Nidhogg.Thor tried to kill him himself as he was secretly jealous of the Viking child being the one foretold to kill the dragon and prevent Ragnarok.He was able to make it back to the mountain but does in the process.So our young hero’s quest begins!I would want this to take place in Iceland.I was thinking about either double axes or scythes as main weapons that are forged of dwarven steel and a handle made of wood from the tree of life.The steel would also be magically infused to call the strength of the mightiest warriors of Valhalla.I would also have the game open world filled with creatures from Norse mythology as mini or actual bosses scattered across the map.I am not sure if this is like any other games but I thought it would be a cool idea.Please let me know how you think this would be and if it’s even a good idea!",videogames,Norse Video Game Idea

"When I was a kid, a little under ten years old (I'm twenty one now), my step dad at the time showed me a game I'd never seen him play before. I remember it being for his PS2, but I guess it's possible it was a PS1 game. I don't remember the intro or any cutscenes or anything. All I remember is the (male) protagonist standing in a green, nature-y area with only one path ahead that lead to a lake with a large rock or hill in front of it. I can't accurately remember what he looked like, but there was a kind of weapon wheel mechanic, and he had a beam sword that took multiple forms, one of which was a kind of staff. I can't remember the color of the weapon(s). It was in third person, and must've been a hack and slash. 

Back to the area wherein this all takes place. Lot of greenery, rocks, etc. There's that lake ahead, but you can't swim across because there's a big rock or hill that cuts the lake in half. The goal here is simple: dive into the water, and resurface at the other side to progress forward. The only problem was, the rock/whatever is went down quite a ways, and by the time we reached the bottom or went underneath to the other side, we would always drown before reaching the surface.

We tried over and over again, to no avail. I vaguely remember bubbles either floating up from our character as we dove or bubbles representing how much time we had left before drowning.

That's all I remember about the gameplay. The only other thing I remember is what the cover art on the disc looked like, and by that, I remember what the text on it looked like. The title, I'm assuming, was orange with a very.. bubbly font. Kind of like graffiti, like the title for Naruto. 

And that's it. Thats all I remember about it before my step dad got ao frustrated he threw it at a wall, shattering the disc to pieces. 

I'd really appreciate some suggestions as to what this game might have been. I swear it's not Phantasy Star, I played the Hell out of that game as a kid, and I don't remember any swimming.",videogames,"Looking for an old PS2 (maybe PS1) game I saw once as a kid.

For years I’ve heard amazing things about this franchise. I always felt left out when pals talked about the series. So last year I decided to finally play some of them. 

I first went with X. That’s the one I’ve heard so many good things about. Every time I hear it spoken of it’s in the highest regard. I didn’t have that experience. 

Admittedly I only played ten hours of it and couldn’t bare no more. It just wasn’t for me. I appreciate it’s appeal but I just couldn’t get into it. 

Then I got VII and absolutely loved every single second. I’ve played it three times since. It’s story, characters and gameplay are all so exciting I want to hop back in writing this out. Point being though, I loved it. 

Then I tried XV and it felt so mediocre. Not horrible but not amazing either.

Back in 2010-11, i remember the time when i was going through flipnote hatena, where i watch many flipnotes such as the stick fights, music videos, sprite videos, and a long etc, i remember going back to the channel list of the main page of the flipnotes, the series list was so great, which thanks to that i discovered a series called suika that were created by a flipnote artist with the same name as the series, then i found another english flipnote series which had some edgy themes, which i like it, the only thing i remember the title card with kinda looked liked like suika but its was a cross with little triangles in each end and a small circle in the center, i try my best to describe the episodes i remember

the first episode of the series started with a blood drop, and then there's a scene of a white haired girl wearing black clothes was standing at some street while it was raining, she had blood in her mouth, then there's a shot of her arms and legs bleeding, then there's a shot of her eye, which was red and her head was bleeding too, so she closed her eyes, then it cuts into a flashback that shows the same white haired girl talking with a black haired one(which it was her friend) and then a gray/black haired boy was smiling evily., all of this was animated while the song ""kiss my eyes and lay me to sleep"" by afi was playing.

and there was chapter 4(i guess) which the previous protag from chapter one(the black haired girl) yelling at the boy from chapter one for killing the white haired girl, the music ""In the shadows"" by ramus was playing.

and the last chapter i remember of that dark series, is that the white haired girl was resurrected by a holy sign which looked like the one from the title card

All on one disc, no DLC or Micro Transactions. 

Game Modes.
1. Story Mode 
2. Tournament Mode
----- 5 Different Tournaments including The Cell Games
3. Duel (2 Player 1v1 or 5v5 character choice.)
4. Ultimate Battle
Which includes...

-Sim Dragon (a simulation Adventure where you fight random opponents and collect items)
- Survival (Fight till you lose.)
- Disc Fusion (exclusively on the PlayStation 2 version)
- Mission 100.
100 different story options where you customize your fighter and try to survive through 100 fights of harder and harder enemies. 

8 Story Modes-
1. Dragon Ball Saga
2. Saiyen Saga
3. Frieza Saga
4. Android Saga
5. Majin Buu Saga
6. GT Saga 
7. Special Saga (Movies and Lore)
----16 Different stories
8. What If Saga? 

Maps.
23 maps! 8 with different variations!

Night Maps with a Moon allow Great Ape transformations with any Saiyen with their tail intact. 

Characters!

93 different characters! 161 if you count the variations! (Great Ape, Baby Vegeta, Super Saiyen, Different forms, etc.)

A customizing mode to alter your saved fighter's health, attack, defense, Ki, etc.)

And! To top it off, every fight in any game mode allows you a chance to find a Dragon Ball. Gather all 7, and go the Dragon Ball location in the map to summon Shenron or the Namekian Dragon, Porunga. (To unlock characters, stories, items.)

"Hi! New to this sub. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post but I'm looking for a horror game I played a while back. 

I believe the whole premise was the main character was contacted by an unknown number, who I'll call Person X for the sake of this post. Person X was texting the player about committing some unsavoury activities towards their person, and it was the players job to talk to Person X. What followed where various dialogue options. 

The game was fairly short, but there were plenty of endings. In the texting stage, you could convince Person X to contact the authorities, have Person X hang up on you, reaffirm Person X's beliefs and encourage them to engage in their behaviour, or try to reason with Person X yourself. 

If you reason with them, the texting portion of the game ends, and you get the option to visit Person X's house, from there, they'll either shut the player out of their house, kidnap the player, fall in love with the player or kill the player from what I can remember. 

The text portion of the game was white text on a black or dark background, it might've been a picture of a forest, but I can't remember. Text would appear on the left side of the screen. Once the text portion is cleared, and if the player decide's to visit the unknown caller, you're greeted with and image of someone peeking through their front door, the image is also dark, but is tinted pink in certain places. Kinda like that effect you get where you wear 3D glasses. 

That's all I can remember. If you have any ideas please let me know, thank you very much!",videogames,Looking for a Horror Game?

"What is your top 10 personal favorite video games ? Not that they are the best, but you still love it


10. Sonic Generations :
Starting strong. Starting with the one and only blue blur, Sonic. I love the game so much and i can't believe that it's was 10 year ago. And the soundtrack is on the point, by the way, it's not gonna be the only Sonic game of the list :)

9. NBA 2K11 :
Yeah, the best basketball game. The Jordan mode is goated, and i had so much memory of this game and this game is probably will never be toped by NBA 2K again.

8. Grand Theft Auto V :
Wow, such a surprise lol. This game is still being played to this day, it's officially the only game to have made 3 differents of generation of gaming. (PS3-Xbox 360,PS4- Xbox series S and now the new Xbox and the Playstation)

7. Kingdom Hearts on PS2 :
I love this game. Like, really. Don't know what to say more.

6. Call Of Duty Black Ops 2 :
The best COD ever. Don't even @ with me. You just have to listen to Adrenaline soundtrack to understand that you're not playing a typical game, but the best one. 

5. Dragon Ball Z Budokai 3 :
Oh boy. #RIP for the joystick. This game... Is the best DBZ games EVER. Until Fighterz. BUT, before that, it's was the best. The gameplay, jeez, one of the most fun gameplay i have ever played. To the dodge, the special attack, the ultimate attack, the BEAM STRUGGLE. ALL IS HERE TO MAKE US BELIEVE THAT IT'S A DBZ GAME. 

4. SmackDown VS RAW 2007 :
Yeaaaaah, this is the best wrestling game of all time, the best GM mode of all time, the best of everything that a wrestling game can have, it's the best, don't even bring SmackDown Here Comes The Pain, it's doesn't even be considered as a equal to SVR 2007. Nah im joking, but yeah, SVR 2007 is imo the goat of wrestling game, everything you want from a wrestling game is here.

3. Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas :
*Ah shit, here we go again*.  this game is a perfect exemple of an excellent balance between gameplay and the story-line. The greatest Grand Theft Auto game ever, honestly, i did wanted to put GTA 4 here, but 3 GTA would have been too much, so i had to choose between GTA 4 and the 5. The only reason i choose the 5, simply because it's was seem too logic to pick GTA 4 because it's the better game, so i choose GTA 5. Yeah, im that kind of person. Anyways, GTA SA is a masterpiece.

2. Sonic Adventure 2 Battle :
Ok, ok, ok, ok, ok. I know what you're gonna say. But listen, SA2 Battle is such a fun game. Remember, i did say that this list is not about the best game but about the favorite. If it's was about the best game, 1st, i wouldn't put this game in this list, and 2nd, certainly not above GTA SA. But i enjoy this game more than GTA SA, yes, * more*. Like in a scale, the difference between the 2 of my list and the rest of the list is a little bit big. Anyways, I'm going to explain you why SA2 Battle is my 2nd favortie game of all time :






















ROLLING AROUND AT THE SPEED OF SOUND, GOT PLACES TO GO, GOTTA FOLLOW MY RAINBOW
CAN'T STICK AROUND, HAVE TO KEEP MOVIN' ON, GUESS WHAT LIES AHEAD, ONLY WAY TO FIND OUT




I AIN'T GONNA LET IT GET TO ME, IM JUST GONNA CREEP, DOWN IN PUMPKIN HILL I GOTS' TO FIND MY LAWEST PEACE, I KNOW THAT IT'S HERE I CAN SENSE IT IN MY FEET, THE GREAT EMERALD POWA ALLOWS ME TO FEEL





FLY IN THE FREEDOM! TELL ME WHAT IS THIS FEELING, SHOW THE WAYYYYY! IM IN A PARADISE, I'LL KEEP IT FOREVER, FLY IN THE FREEDOM, I'LL NEVER STIR UP MY STEPS, I BELIEVE IN MYSELF ; I KNOW THAT I CAN ; SURE I KNOW!




My love for this game is immeasurable. The Sonic/Shadow rivalry is one of the best in gaming history, Live &amp; Learn is one of the best boss soundtrack in gaming history, Escape From The City is one of the best opener level and soundtrack in gaming history. In short, it's one of the best game of all time. Nah joking, it's not one of the best game of all time, but all i did say before is true. I know, this game have major flaws, like Eggman gameplay, and Knuckles/Tails gameplay wasn't better than the SA1, it's probably even worse. Also, i did wanted to put SA1 DX on the list, but it's would have made 3 Sonic games in the top 10, what i found too much. So i had to choose between SA1 and SA2. I think that SA2 apart for the Sonic gameplay, did worse for Tails and Knuckles. The soundtrack of each game are goated, but SA1 has music that is more varied, SA1 have my fav' soundtrack in Sonic franchise with Sonic CD Japanese version. So why did i pick SA2 Battle over SA1 then? The multiplayer mode. The multiplayer mode is so fun, and it's the best multiplayer mode in Sonic history. Yeah, the only reason i prefer SA2 over SA1 even if SA1 is a better game, is because of the multiplayer, solid argument isn't it? Total objectivity here.

1. Call Of Duty Moder Warfare 2 :
Did i say BO2 was the best COD game ever? MANN F*CK THIS SH*T, MW2 IS THE BEST GAME EVA OF HISTORY OF MANKIND NO GAME CAN TOUCH THIS MASTERPIECE, and that is a fact, my friend. Ok, it's not. Why i love this game so much? Campaign mode. The campaign mode was made by Christopher Nolan. It's the best campaign mode of every COD, it's the best COD, and it's one of the best first person shooter game of all time. Between this game and SA2 Battle, it's very close i still choose MW2 becaude it's have my favorite Multiplayer in COD, my favorite campaign story in COD, have the best scene in COD, history too. DO NOT TRUST SHEPHERD, I REPEAT, DO NOT TRUST SHEPHERD! Seeing my man Ghost been killing make me cry. And the last scene of the game is the best final scene in COD history, behind, Makarov death, for sure. Killin' Shepherd make me so happy, but when i think about it, Shepherd heel turn is totally justified, but you kill Ghost, that's unforgivable. Oh, and also, *No Russian*.

"So, I'm a student attending university. I live in a college apartment, and the thing that has been annoying me since I arrived here is the fact that one of my two roommates always yells when playing video games.

It just feels so weird that, at 20-something, someone can get so angry at video games all the time that they yell at them over trivial and dumb things. He gets angry over the fact that he loses, his tm8s suck, etc. etc. It's not even just occasionally, it's all the time, almost everyday.

Now, I'm not disregarding the fact that I occasionally get tilted when playing competitive games. But if I start getting tilted, I don't keep playing. If I start getting tilted, I turn off my PC and either listen to music or take a walk. It just doesn't make sense to me that people in adulthood could still get so angry at something so trivial.

I think that using a buff/debuff system for hunger would be a lot better and make much more sense than a bar that has to be filled by eating a lot of food at once... Like, make something balanced, you have to eat a little bit every once in a while else you get a debuff that makes you slower/less efficient at everything, since hunger tends to cause that on humans, and eventually even sleeping should become harder because of that debuff and such. That goes the other way too, eat well and you'll get buffed, working and walking faster and more efficiently... Eat too much and you'll get a stomach ache and get a debuff, get dizzy or something... You know, this would work a lot better in my opinion, especially on games that already have mechanics that synergize, like sleeping bonuses on xp gain and such. Sounds good?",videogames,Hunger in games

"While attending Texas A&amp;M 30 years ago (1991), I played quite a bit of a MUD called Genocide (LP-MUD engine).  Genocide was the world's first internet Battle Royale (with other modes, if you wanted to vote for them).  At the end of a match, the world would get yanked out from under your feet and you'd be placed in a shrinking arena until the last man (or team) was standing.  The game hosts classes, equipment gathering, inventory, magic spells, and tons of weapons.  While it is text based, the game was decades ahead of its time in terms of game play.

  
I believe it's the longest running PvP RPG game on the internet.  At its height, there were battles of over 50 people.  I do not remember the highest amount of players hosted, though (would love some feedback).  


At the time, it was run out of SHSU (Sam Houston State University).  I connected through the lab in the  Zachry engineering building.  At the time, they had a Cray computer up on the first floor surrounded by glass.  I was amazed at how fast it was.  Playing Genocide led me to making my own MUD's and basic libraries for other game developers to create with (NightmareLIB).  


I'd love to hear from folks that played it at the time!  I remember Fireblade, Vaxman, Woot, and a few others.  I played as ""Fang"".

"Hello everyone,
I have three games to choose from:
- RDR2
- Fallout 4
- AC Origins

I never played any games from Fallout or Red Dead Series. I played AC Black Flagbut didn't finish the game because I really liked the stealth missions but missed RPG mechanics like leveling, skills, etc. In Black Flag there were Ship Upgrades (I find ship fights difficult to handle and don't like them so much) and some armor upgrades, thats all + The story was not very thrilling. I liked it, but didn't love it. What I loved was the parcouring. I liked to have the possibility to climb on every building.

My favourite games are Skyrim, Zelda:BotW and The Witcher 3. Each of them blew me away in a different way. I loved the sandbox of Skyrim, loved the fighting and the story in TW3 and had a unforgettable time exploring every little inch of Hyrule with its beautiful world. I loved in every three games the settings in a fantasy, medieval world.

Now after completing Skyrim I want to go on a new adventure together with my new PS4 Pro (played every other game on Switch). Fallout is 'Skyrim with guns' from what I expect and I normally don't really like playing 1st Person shooter games. RDR2 has a overwhelming open world from what I heard from reviews and has a lot of things to do. But I heard that RDR2 is REALLY slow with everything. AC Origins has parcouring, a great story (?) and has also more RPG mechanics than older AC games + the fighting system looks quite similar to Witcher/inspired by Dark Souls. But has AC Origins Quests, etc?
I am unsure what I should play now, because all of this games will take a lot time I can't use to play the other ones^^ I want to see a new setting and have fun questing and following big or little stories, help people, save the world, see my character develop and sometimes play some mini games like Poker, etc.

"As the title says, I can only get into one game at a time - I buy a game, I play it obsessively, but once I get a new game I can't bring myself to play it again.
It's definitely not good value for money and I'm worried I'm missing out on great indie games.

The last game I properly got into was Call Of Duty Modern Warfare, until a friend invited me to play Star Wars Battlefront 2, I have now only played on this game since October last year. I almost get obsessed about collecting everything in these games. Especially grinding out camos in MW.

I'm thinking about getting the xbox game pass because of the new Halo coming out but I'm worried I won't utilise it.

For the sake of this spitball, I will refer to an entity, that I believe would be integral to the successful implementation of the rest of the ideas, as 'The Company'.

**The Company** hosts a **website** related to the creation of video games. 

**Users** visit the **website** for one of two primary reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

1. To *contribute* **ideas** (and other resources\*) for video games that do not exist
2. To *view* and *vote* on **ideas**  
 

Once a **user's idea** reaches a certain **threshold of positive reception**:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The **idea** gets **pinned**/flagged/starred to the **front page** of the **website**
2. **User's** may now *contribute* **money** to *ideas*
3. **User's** may *accept* the current **money** available and *agree* to *create* the **described game**  
 

Once a **user's idea** has been *accepted*:

&amp;#x200B;

1. No further **money** may be *contributed* to the **idea**
2. The **original contributing user** is notified, as well as all **users** who *contributed* **money**
3. The *accepting* **user(s)** are given a deadline to *create* and *submit* a *working* **alpha** version of the **described game** for *review*

From this point, it is likely best described ‘conversationally’. Essentially, a complex or well-funded idea may take more time to create than a simple or low-budget one. The intricacies of how the development or deadline portion of this would obviously be up to the discretion of **The Company**, and hopefully the contributing users, but the most important final points are this:

**No one gets paid until the product is finished. Period. This is pay-it-forward to play.** 

**Original idea contributor gets credit and royalties on the game, as do all initial ‘investors’.**

**The Company gets a probably large portion of profits due to risk involved, legalities of holding money, etc., etc., etc.**

Obviously, some real effort and work would need to go into the engineering of the process, finding/flagging ‘copy cats’ or people who will invariably try to game the system by reposting other people’s ideas with better flair/wording/whatever, not to mention a large number of things that might need ironing out. All I know is that while kickstarter and the like has been a step in the right direction, the Early Access stuff has GOT TO STOP, and I think we all want to see games with *more* character and *less* bugs.

"This is something that has usually always aggravated me. The most annoying examples I can think of, are poison bogs in Demon's/Dark Souls, purple sludge from Doom Eternal, or to a lesser extent, acid pits from Metroid Prime. I wouldn't count paralysis status, just environmental obstacles that limit mobility.

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent example for me, is 20 minutes ago I was playing Code Vein, (anime Dark Souls) and I'm fighting through the Pit of Hollows. Sure, there's no poison status to deal with, but there's no special mechanic to this area at all. It's like two devs were talking, one said, ""Remember Farron Keep from Dark Souls 3? Let's copy that."" Dev 2 said, ""Okay, but let's take poison out of the equation. Let's just make everyone fat roll and move slow as crap so they can truly appreciate how ugly and generic our Farron Keep ripoff looks."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'll give some props to Blighttown in the first Dark Souls because most of it can be skipped. And Farron Keep actually had some cool mechanics, the area looked beautiful (in a putrid, atmospheric way) but the Pit of Hollows just seems to wish frustration on the player and it's not even hard. It even has a map. Doom Eternal's purple sludge is really, really annoying too, but at least they didn't design a whole 40 minute level around it. And with Metroid Prime, any acid/lava pit is supposed to be avoided, meaning it sucks if you get blasted into a pit or miss a jump, and it might be too hard to get out depending on your HP or the depth of the pit. There's no way to avoid the shit in alot of other games.

Does anyone even like or appreciate these mechanics? At all? Or do we all just slog through them since it's mandatory and we just want to get back to the GOOD parts of video games?",videogames,Opinions on Mobility limiting mechanics in fast paced video games?

"This post is for people who know the InFAMOUS games, you know, infamous one, two, second son, first light, I have some ideas and thoughts on what could possibly be the next one.


Idea #1: Augustine as the protagonist. 
Hear me out, remember in the final fight of infamous second son when it shows Augustine's backstory? I figured that the next game can revolve around her, and her traveling through cities of people who hated bioterrosists, trying to survive and live as the game tells out the story of her and the conduit child she was with as she makes her way back to her betallion. Maybe the enemies you fight are the lynch mob she mentions,or maybe you dont fight them and you try to escape them, since she says she hurt no one. The idea is a complicated, unrealistic one, but I think it's a fun idea to think about.

Idea #2: Delsins plan backfires.
I know Delsin went back home from Seattle to heal Betty, but before that at the end of infamous second son, infamous set free the conduits of Curdan Cay. I figured, what if the next infamous game revolved around that plan backfiring, and most of the conduits there were actually criminals, and they start going back to their old ways. And maybe a lot of them do get killed, and Augustine was kinda right. Maybe Fetch could get Delsin come back to Seattle, or maybe one of them has to do things and save Seattle. It's this idea of mine that I think is the most unrealistic, even more unrealistic then idea 1 and 3. Not to say that any of these ideas are realistic at all.

Idea #3: Evil Coles story
I've seen a few stories in games and other media where the protagonist isn't really the good guy. I would argue that InFAMOUS Festival Of Blood is like this, since Cole is a good guy, he still had the urge and gives in to it to kill people and drink their blood. Arguements aside, it think a game that has Evil Cole as the protagonist would be pretty fun, although I dont know what the plot would be and that there likely wouldnt be a karma choice that most of the infamous games have, I still think it would be fun.

All of these ideas are only rough fantasies on what could probably be an infamous games, but there just ideas i love to come up with and think about. Tell me what you guys think, I'll doubt that these will ever be infamous game material, but I just wanna know if anybody else thinks these would he somewhat interesting. Especially the first idea in my opinion, it's my favorite idea. I just wanna know what you think",videogames,My thoughts and ideas on what could be the next InFAMOUS game
"   I have had a couple of ideas in the past about a video game but this is the idea I’ve recently thought of: I want it to be about pirates and stuff. You start off designing your starter ship which you can upgrade later in the game. I don’t really want to have a set story, I’d rather have the community make one up, assuming the game gets any attention. You slowly build your crew up or make upgrades to your ship by maybe completing quests. The actual looting system would be by completing quests or finding them in the ocean. I feel like a problem I would run into would be keeping the game exciting because for most of the game you are at sea finding gold and stuff. I think there should be islands that you can explore with a lot of wildlife and treasure. There should also be monsters you have to fight. I also want there to be colonies and land you could claim. I could make it an online game but I don’t know how that would work. Any game design or coding suggestions/tips would be greatly appreciated.",videogames,Developing a video game would be nice

"Basically, I had the most weird realization today that I haven’t found anything about. Essentially I like a lot of different genres but generally the same “type” of game, and I finally figured out what it is.

Essentially games can be put into four categories based on attention (focus needed to play the game well) and stress (the amount your actions in the game affect the rest of the game).

Low stress and low attention games would include things like Minecraft and other sandboxes, free roaming games with unlimited saves or other games that you can fix mistakes and can watch YouTube videos with.

Low stress and high attention games would be mostly match based games like call off duty, over watch or any games that you need to focus on but your outcome doesn’t affect your game play after (no permanent/semi-permanent punishments for losing, other than maybe K/D ratios).

High stress and high attention games would be things like beholder, dark souls or any game where you could miss something that would affect the rest of the games in an extreme way. Or, games that penalize you greatly for dying.

"I’ve recently been playing through some old PS4 games as I wait for my PS5, and I am having an insane amount of fun with Batman’s combat in Arkham Knight. It feels very smooth and the depth of the combat is amazing, I love how the game invites you to play as you want: Aggressive combat or Stealth combat. 

I personally choose stealth (which tbh is necessary on hard difficulty) and it’s so fucking fun moving around the vantage points to do inverted takedowns and sliding into the grates to do silent takedowns. I also love how the game allows you to continue to be stealthy because of the playful environment the game gives you, the game is quite literally Batman’s playground and there are SO many ways to approach each fight.

"Hello everyone,

A good friend of mine was telling me about a PC game she used to play a lot and after a discussion, along with hours of google searching, we decided it was time to ask for help!

It was a game that seemed to have ""toy"" animals and when the player plays a game (there are several games to pick from) the game would have the toy in them seemingly brought to life (not sure if the size of the animal changed) and this was the most prominent memory of the game in question.  
The player needed to collect stars (we believe, but could be a different collectable) from various places. The game is NOT top down in the same way the sims is and the animation is unlike most games, My friend describes the amination as smooth and without a black outline around everything including the animals!  My friend slightly remembers a giraffe and monkey in the game and on the front cover.

That is about all she can recall and even some of the recollection is hazy and possibly misremembered.   
I know this is a tall order but we would be very grateful if anybody remembers anything like this :)",videogames,Long Lost Videogame - Any Help Appreciated

I felt myself getting a little frustrated so I went and played smash bros online for a little while. 

Every game (I played 4) the other player teabagged me every time they got a stock on me. 

I know I shouldn’t care at all, and I try not to, but it just feels like every multiplayer game I play lately just leaves me feeling frustrated, not because of my lack of skill, or something wrong with the game but just because people feel like being dicks. And to clarify I don’t mind losing. I lose all the time, that’s how games work and I expect to lose at the very least 50% of games. I don’t feel even a little frustrated after losing a game to a normal player.

"Hi everyone, this is a question for those of you who are familiar with videogames;

I'm not a gamer, I'll start there. My household growing up was veeery strict regarding them and the only games I've played are The Sims and some Harry Potter PS2 games 1h at most (screentime rules ya know).

Now, my boyfriend of nearly 2 years is a biiig gamer, I've seen him play pretty much all types of PC and console games there are, some of his favorites include Hunt: Showdown, Rainbow 6 Siege and CoD. I find those games interesting and highly entertaining, but since I have absolutely no experience with action games like that, my attempts at playing them are fucking sad.

My question here is, could some of you guys suggest some PC or console games that we could maybe play together, something that might be easy for me to learn but still something that my boyfriend might enjoy as well? Can be horror, the genre doesn't really matter, just something you yourself have found entertaining and ""rookie friendly"".

"License video games often tend to suck do to them having lack ambition or creativity, giving them the stigma of shovel ware. However I'm of the belief that you can make a good game out of anything if you try.

So what are some movies/tv shows that you think could make good video games, and how would you do them?

Mine is an odd pick, but I feel I think George Lucas's 1973 classic American Graffiti  would make for a perfect sandbox video game. What I'm imagining  is a game mixed Driver and Bully, with the atmosphere of The Coin game. 

Set in 1964, The premise of the game, on your last night of  high school, you must prepare for the big senior year drag race the next  day by raising money in one night by buying a Corvette Sting Ray, aswell as competing in a-lot   drag street racing with the local .  To earn money you go do little challenges  such as going on a date with richest women in town, winning the Freshman sock hop competition, obtaining tickets to for a sold out  Beatles concert for a group of girls, and doing pranks for a local greaser game, and most importantly winning the  street drag races.

However unlike GTA, Bully, or Driver, it's more laid back, atmospheric, witch Is why I compare it Coin game, were you don't have to follow the story and just relax and do stuff in town such as going to the arcade, playing basketball/Baseball, Fishing, or going to the soda shop and doing a dance mini game, or just driving around town listening to music the 1950s- and early 60s taking in the towns atmosphere.

Also, another idea I have(and I'm surprised no other game has done this) is go either to the drive in, or movie theater and watch a double feature of some public domain horror b movies in their entirety, plus some public domain cartoons, plus alot of character customization options.

"Recently I’ve been playing several new games off game pass and I’ve been noticing more and more that the eyes of the main characters in a lot of newer video games just seem... off. Like they don’t blink right or feel stiff, or don’t seem to be a part of the world that the story is in. It takes me out of the immersion so quickly that it’s often hard to watch things like cutscenes and dialogue. It almost crosses into the uncanny valley, but I don’t think that’s the exact term I would use. 

I wouldn’t question it as much if it were in similar genres, but this has been across the board! “Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order’” “NFS Heat,” and now “Tell Me Why,” are the 3 most recent games I’ve played that I noticed this on. Yet games like “Outerworlds,” or “Prey,” or even older games like “Uncharted” don’t seem to have this same issue. 

Has anyone else noticed this? I feel like it’s the first thing I see when I play these games and it’s almost impossible to ignore. 

Is there a reason for this? Is there something that spans across all these titles and genres that ties them all together? Are there hardware limitations or limitations in modern gaming engines? Is it something that is overlooked in game design? Or is this just something that happens when designers try to up the graphical fidelity and realism?

I am 27 and looking to buy some consoles to mainly play solo, online and with my gf (also 27). The last console I had was the Wii and I have only had Nintendo products (Gamecube, N64, GBA).

Question, if I get a PS5 should I get a switch or switch lite?  I feel like having a Switch and PS5 is a bit much. Or, is the docked Switch experience worth getting it over the better handheld lite and comparable to a PS5?  Here are some of the games I would consider...

PS5- Red Dead, COD, GTA, MLB/NBA/FIFA 

Switch- Super Mario 64/Party, Zelda, Pokémon

Switch Lite- Mainly Pokémon (still love Pokemon from my GBA days), other suggestions?

"So as the title says, I'm trying to find a videogame that I once saw, though my search has been quite fruitless for months now. I only saw so much of it, but I'm hoping the amount of information that I am able to remember and give here will be enough for someone to eventually help point me in the right direction. I will do my best to only state what I can remember with certainty as to not cause potential confusion.  


First, I saw the beginning of the gameplay on the YouTube account IGN. My dad had set up the video on the TV, though I'm fairly certain that the video was a compilation of sorts where it would only show so much gameplay time before changing to a different videogame. This is where I saw the particular videogame that I'm trying to find again.  


The videogame in question was 3D and first person perspective. The player, who appeared to be a robot of some sort, seemed to be the only humanoid in sight. The character you play as in the game also seemed to have digitigrade/animalistic legs, and I could tell because there was a little picture of the robot off to the side somewhere on the screen. I think this was supposed to show how much energy the robot had stored in it, because the robot was able to wander around and look for small, glowing blue crystals that it could absorb the energy out of. The robot was also able to absorb energy out of the living trees around the slightly forested map, then transfer this energy into dead trees to make them living again. The robot was only able to hold so many charges at once, so this was limited.  


The starting map was like a sparse forest, and there might've been worn dirt paths here and there. The robot was able to run really fast, though not to anywhere near a supersonic speed. It could also jump really high, possibly as tall as the trees. After a while of wandering around, the robot was able to discover and enter some kind of stone building, one that looked very old with plants growing over it. I'm fairly certain that this building entrance was part of some kind of ruins. After the robot entered, I think the door locked shut behind it, leaving the robot stuck inside of a puzzle room. There were some blue crystals in this room, which I presume was to ensure that the robot (and therefore the player) would have enough charges to get through the room's puzzle.  


Beyond all of this, however, I cannot remember anything else about the game. I've not even the slightest hint of what this game's name is, but I would be so happy if I could find it again. I thank you all for taking the time to read this and for any help you are able to give. I hope you have a wonderful day\~ /)\^v\^(\\",videogames,I've forgotten the name of a videogame and am trying to find it again. Can anyone help me?

My all time favorites are Metro Exodus and Fallout New Vegas, but obviously that’s not going to work since I can’t use WSAD. 

I do get into strategy games like Civ 5 though, so maybe some ideas in that realm? I’ve also played games like Terraria and Stardew Valley with my wife and really enjoyed them, so I’m pretty open minded!

Bonus points if it’s multiplayer! I mostly use PC but I also have a Nintendo Switch if you have any ideas for that

"A video game that focus’s on the eastern front of WW2. Its basically a video game about the beginning of Code Red and I think it would be really fun.

Start: at the start of the game you create your character ( no black or female options not because I’m racist or sexist but because of historical accuracy ) after you made your character you pick a class out of 4 you choose 1. The first one is rifleman: with this class the are given an STG 44 and as a sidearm you get given a Walter p38. The medic : MP 40 with a Steyr-Hahn m1912 gadgets are bandages . Sniper: karabiner 98k side arm is a Selbester m1916 gadgets are spotter scope and a smoke grenade. Officer, Lugar, gadgets are AP mine’s.

The story summarised: a group of German soldiers who realise that they’re not just fighting for the fatherland but also committing genocide, unfortunately for the squad they had already been deployed to Stalingrad, having already killed some fellow nazis to free some civilians from execution the former nazis can’t surrender to ether side, so they fight they’re way to Norway to trie and surrender to the British, Canadian’s or Americans.

Why is chess and poker widely considered sports?

Technically speaking, it actually isn’t. The International Federation Of Poker tried to join the SportAccord but they refused, meaning it is not really a sport. This is mostly because they do not actually fit the known definition of sports. Sports being defined as “Sports are games such as football and basketball and other competitive leisure activities which need physical effort and skill.” by the collins dictionary. That is where the International Mind Sports Association comes in, they joined with several other groups and classified things like chess and poker as mind sports.

What is a mind sport?

Not many dictionaries actually recognize the term, however the collins dictionary comes in once again. They define mind sports as “any of various competitive games based on intellectual capability, such as chess or bridge”.

Why are video games not sports?

While some new advancements in virtual reality tech has added a physically aspect to video games, with some games like beat saber actually being able to compare to an actual exercise in terms of calories burned. However no virtual reality game has yet to become seriously competitive. 

What about mind sports? 

Video games like Dota 2 and Smite require a similar level or greater level of intelligence to chess or poker, with far more variables and requiring team coordination more similar to true sports like soccer or basket ball. They also have more popularity then other real mind sports like speed reading. With all of that in mind, why would competitive video games not be considered at least mind sports? My personal theory is this is all due to simplicity, simply put while games like basket ball and chess require advance strategies and a great amount of skill, the basic idea and the general watching experience is simple and easy to understand. However because games like Smite do not have turns, speed becomes far more important. In addition, items, abilities, and cool downs just to name a few are additional aspects the players have to take in to account every second. As a viewer without having a understanding of all the different characters and builds, it becomes difficult to understand even basic game strategies, and trying to watch play without that understanding it just looks like a chaotic mess. Thus do to popular competitive games lacking simplicity, an audience has to have a greater extent of knowledge of the game to enjoy watching it. This makes it near impossible to have casual fans of the competitions, which is why I believe video games have not been, and likely never will be recognized as a mind sport.

OF NOTE: I personally do not agree with this decision, and I am of the mind set that video games should be mind sports like chess, poker, and speed reading. This is simply my take on why the general populous and international organizations believe chess is worthy of being a sport and video games are not.

You're not a speedrunner, and the game JUST released so you're discovering at the same time as the internet. You talk to everyone in towns so you don't miss any clues, you do all the missions presented to you, you seem to level up along the curve so you can move through the dungeons at a moderate pace.

I focus on how games are able to captivate the player to provide an escape from reality and how games brought people together online more than ever last year.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a year filled with uncertainty and despair, many of us longed for a way to disconnect from reality while isolated at home. Some enjoyed the peace and quiet of reading books and found themselves captivated by the stories. Others dove into their favorite TV shows and movies to escape from work and experience new worlds. Myself? I found happiness and disconnect in a corner of my bedroom, at my computer desk, where hours upon hours were spent enjoying the latest video games of 2020.

Video games have historically had a negative social stigma associated with them. Growing up, video games were generally what nerdy boys like myself did all day and what we got scolded for wasting too much time on by our parents. Today, boys and girls of all ages are captivated by the unique experiences that video games create. Adults of all backgrounds are gaming more than ever as it becomes easier to try new games. Professional gaming, live streaming, and content creation have become full-time jobs for thousands, and it is clear now more than ever that our society has expanded beyond viewing gaming simply as a hobby. Within the last twenty years, an interest in gaming has become much more normalized as the barriers to entry decrease and accessibility to video games grows.

# An Escape from Lockdown

I was certainly not alone this year indulging in video games during the pandemic lockdowns. A Nielsen article from June 2020 noted that ""82% of global consumers played video games and watched video game content during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns."" Another report from Deloitte showed that 43% of Millennials tried a new video gaming activity during the pandemic:

*Processing img tgokba1l8na61...*

Gaming was clearly an outlet for many of us this past year and it has been amusing to see people of all backgrounds enjoy video games in their homes, with their families, and with friends online. Video games offer a type of interactivity and immersion that reading and TV truly cannot replicate. With a controller (or mouse 😊) in your hand, you alone are responsible for the actions of your character in the game’s universe. While the story is generally written for you, how you experience the story is up to you. Video games have the ability to absorb us in a way where every action we perform makes it feel like we are truly part of the game. This escape from reality is something I found myself longing for during the long days spent at home this past year.

# A Way to Connect

Although face-to-face conversation with others was limited this past year, online conversations with friends old and new filled the void. While virtual happy hours and Zoom calls with friends were exciting for the first few weeks of lockdowns, I think many would agree they eventually became a chore as video chat fatigue set in.

I would say that a lot of people overlook the incredible social aspect of multiplayer video games. Of course, the general population is aware of the popular party games - Jackbox Games, Among Us, and the like. But few realize that many popular video games are best played with others. The top video games on Twitch this year, a list which includes League of Legends, Fortnite, Call of Duty, Fall Guys, and Minecraft, are all arguably the most enjoyable when playing with friends. In a survey from The German Games Industry Association, 27% of gamers said they played with family and friends more often than usual during the pandemic (note this survey focused on those who were gamers before the pandemic and does not necessarily include those who only play games with friends and family):

*Processing img hsatu0ll8na61...*

Gaming during the pandemic has been invaluable in connecting me with friends that I haven't spoken to in years as we all jumped online with more free time than ever before. I've been able to stay in close contact with my old friends while also meeting new friends online through our mutual interest in video games. Thanks in large part to the popular text and voice communication app Discord, we were able to seamlessly connect online at all hours of the day, frequently hopping into voice chats to catch up while playing together. The recurring contact with friends online was a key factor in helping me maintain normalcy this year while also reconnecting me to old friends I may not have spoken to otherwise.

# Conclusion

The world of gaming has grown exponentially in the last decade and it's been a joy to watch more of my friends and family explore and enjoy video games. I’ve watched as friends who have never touched games tried Animal Crossing on their new Nintendo Switches. I’ve invited friends to play Among Us on their mobile phones to join in on the fun. Seeing the connections that video games have helped us create and develop this past year has been heartwarming. 2020 allowed me to connect with friends old and new in a way that I never would have in a normal year and for that I am grateful. I look forward 2021 with excitement and interest in how the momentum for gaming continues through this year and beyond.

Has gaming provided an escape for you this past year? How was your experience with video games different last year than normal? Drop a comment below and let me know. Also, please let me know of any feedback you have with this type of post. I'd love to make more of these in the future, sharing my experiences and knowledge about the gaming world with others.
