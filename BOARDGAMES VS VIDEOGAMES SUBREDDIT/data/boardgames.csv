"Tabula Games is coming out with a new standalone game within the Mysthea Universe. Many previous titles like Mysthea, Icaion, Mysthea: The Fall, and Volfyirion also connect to this same world giving players many games to play with similar lore. Volfyirion Guilds is a fast-paced deck building game for 2 players and plays around 20-40 minutes. Again, this is a standalone game, so players will not need to own any previous titles, but it also can be combined with Volfyirion amplifying the classic game.

Already know about Volfyirion Guilds? Visit Tabula Games now to check out things further.

**The Story**

Volfyirion Guilds takes placed immediately after the events included in the game Volfyirion and about 60 years before the events in the game Mysthea.

This story focuses on 5 major guilds, all created by the king of Mysthea. In the beginning, these guilds were both small and big Houses formed to pursue the common goal. It’s important to know that one of these biggest and elite guilds was formed and managed by the Volarees family, even though there were also many other smaller families associated with this guild. With time, the system that the king created brought a silent war of power among these guilds, with the focus on the Volarees Guild. 

Disputes arose between between guilds and the strength of Volarees increased more and more with other guilds or houses disappearing including Rorius house. The king being a visionary and intelligent man knew it was time for a political challenge. He empowered other guilds, making sure that Volarees would not be the only powerful force inside his kingdom. His purpose was to divide the power accumulated by the Volarees House without releasing retaliations that could potentially undermine the entire political stability of his kingdom. Before the king made a huge move, he studied out the dynamics between the various families of Ilvash including their passions and weaknesses that could change the entire challenge. 

The story continues as a new Qoam field is discovered at the bottom of one oof the farthest floating islands of Mysthea that hosted a very unique flower. Telron, a talented young Qoam manipulator identified unique properties within the petals of that flower. When those petals are turned into pulp and then burned, it produces fumes that induces divinatory powers when inhaled. Telron was granted ownership of the new field from the scholar guild, and Volaress claimed ownership for the discovery. 

Both the scholar guild and Volaress discussed ownership of this new discovery with one side claiming the importance of studying it and the other the property rights of it. The king saw this and decided to rebalance powers among the guilds redistributing lands forming 5 guilds: *Varorin the Guild of Merchants, Volarees the Guild of Nobility, Lusma the Guild of Faith, Kaetur the Guild of Soldiers, Magista the Guild of Scholars*.

Years later the guilds fight for power using guerrilla and sabotage techniques. With time, luxurious palaces were transformed into command centers and were called Vaults for the secrets that were stored inside them. With time it was then mandatory to enroll in one of the guilds that represented that citizen's interests. But with these changes, fighting between guilds for political and economical power arose ignoring the real needs of the population.

**Mechanics**

Volfyirion keeps all the mechanics used in the base game with an addition giving the game more depth. The game includes 110 new cards including new card types, new abilities, and some additional mechanics. 

The main engine in the game is a system that uses points. Each card that’s played provides a combination of points, and during a turn the player can spend those points to perform actions. 

In the game there are three types of points: command, wonder, and knowledge. Each of these points will allow for different actions to take place. Each player will start with the same cards but players will refine their deck to match their strategy to win the game. In addition, the cards have a system of colors that offer synergies to trigger powerful combinations and unleash chain effects.

**What’s New with the Mechanics?**

If you are familiar with the base game, then you might be wondering how this game differs form that one. Volfyirion Guilds introduces two new card types: Agents, and Vaults. These card types also introduce new mechanics into the game. 

*Agents* – these cards will carry out delicate tasks for the guilds to perform. These cards also help reduce the randomness of the deckbuilding, helping to find ways to acquire certain cards and to improve the management of that turn.

*Vaults* – These are the most important areas of a guild’s command center. They contain all the secrets and valuables for that guild. These cards enhance the strategies and choices for players, but also remove the whims in seeking the conditions to trigger a specific combo. But these all come with a cost, as the vault’s abilities are unlocked when their owner loses a city. This helps the player who is at a disadvantage to be able to catch up to the runaway leader leading to a more balanced match. 

**Ways to Play the Game**

Remember Volfyirion is a standalone game but can still be combined with the base game Volfyirion. As would be expected, if combining the game, it will change the game giving players different actions and an increased variety of cards. 

Also, like the base, solo and coop modes will be available with a renewed feel to them. It will be possible to not only face Volfyirion creatures but also other creatures of Mysthea. The game will come with tarot cards the include the specific rules for these modes. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Highlights of the Game**

It’s a fast-paced game that only lasts 20-40 minutes with intense turns of lots of actions and decisions. The game is easy to learn and takes almost no time to setup yet hard to master as the game is highly strategic and every choice with have a significant impact on the turnout of the game.  The game is also highly replayable and isn’t repetitive as you can choose to play your cards in many different ways combining cards to create synergies and focusing on different paths to victory. The new features in this game will increase the depth of an already very well-liked game adding in new cards with new abilities and new mechanics. 

Again, you can play Volfyirion Guilds as a standalone game, or combine it with the base game Volfyirion causing a different gameplay, you can play solo, or competitive. Additional content and extra rules are going to be released during the Kickstarter campaign, so we can hope for some nice surprises as well. 

**The Dragon Miniature**

Word has been passed down that the 120mm dragon miniature will also be available not only for those interested in backing Volfyirion Guilds but to anyone interested in the dragon miniature itself.

**Art**

The art is done by Travis Anderson with 4 additional illustrators including Andrea Butera. The complete collection of illustrations will be available in a Volfyirion Guilds Artbook.

**Price Point**

The base game is 14€ which is $16.69. This includes 110 cards + Volfyirion Token + 4 Tarots for solo/multiplayer mode + Rulebook. 

**The Box**

The box will include a tray that separates spaces for the main deck, the additional cards and the iconic dragon meeple. The box will be different than the first card game as it will be horizontally oriented and made of a thicker material. The size will let the game be portable and easy to bring along to play in so may places without filling up more room than needed on your board game shelf. There will also be deluxe collector's box available that contain the base game, the old Volyirion and the 2 expansions and will solve functional requirements for those who like sleeves, playmats, and supporting the tokens and components.

"I played Mysterium for the first time yesterday, expecting to have a great time seeing all the wonderful reviews. My excitement quickly turned into panic after my  role as ghost was found very difficult. The cards I picked, and even the new cards after dumping my hand, were not good at first glance. I found myself mulling over which cards to pick while everyone sat watching me and doing nothing. The whole game ended up with me panicking, trying to pick a card while the psychics were bored out of their minds - my mom expressed this openly which made me more anxious to pick cards. I eventually started shuffling through the whole deck trying to pick a card that made any sense for the psychics to interpret. The whole thing was a complete disaster, and I walked away angry at my mom for being such a bad sport and angry with myself for buying such a boring game. 

I really don’t want to regret buying this game. It was expensive as hell, and there’s been so many good reviews. What am I doing wrong? Did anyone else feel the same about Mysterium?",boardgames,Mysterium: Hard Being the Ghost?

I searched Reddit and found a few comments about [Myth](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/140519/myth) - rumour in the Reddit-mill was that it was going to be bought out by someone else or some such? I searched for about an hour or two all over the place, i am ready to ask for help (hence this post).

- Wikipedia has nothing. Like, here is a [wikia](https://myth-board-game.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page). Please, click on that and look at their 'latest news' block. If you go to the [boardgamegeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/140519/myth/forums/63) website you will find many reviews from about half a decade ago. It just died.

- You can buy a version of the game for about $300 or so? It is no longer made. So there.

- It was loved by some but hated by any casual or 'party' TableTop gamer. Apparently D&amp;Ders considered it to be a gateway game? It was said to be better than [Descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent:_Journeys_in_the_Dark) but not as good as the great and almighty GrandMaster [GloomHaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloomhaven), that board game for which none of us are truly worthy / could ever finish all the scenarios.

- this thing started as a kickstarter and survived. The 'retail' version of this game, 2.0, had updated rules that were still confusing and contradictory (and was missing the quests from their first game version apparently). 

- the four guys who made it were from a miniatures company - they looked young, they could not all be dead (possibly eaten... or stolen by aliens for a deep and thorough probing?)

If someone could let me know what the HECK happened to this game i would be most thankful. Surprised, even. It is weird that a game did so incredibly well and when the collective audience said 'we love it, just fix the rules a bit' the publisher said...

Has less luck
Has more replayability

"Sometime during quarantine I hit close to critical mass in my collection. I don't have that many games left on my wish list, so I started to allocate my funds into blinging out/upgrading my favorite titles. Part of that was creating inserts. 

While I'm not opposed to bags (as you can see in the pics) I hate them for components. Players unloading their own pieces isn't a big deal, but I wanted everything else to be easy. These greatly reduced setup/tear down in such a huge way I can't see myself going back. 

When I get a game now, I factor in creating an insert as part of the cost. I have quite a few games to go, but I thought I'd post my early work and give a few tips for others who want to give it a try. 

It's really not as hard or as intimidating as you think!

Materials used: Pins (with round heads), Elmer's All-Glue, Cutting Mat, Stainless Steel Ruler

What's Next: Rising Sun KS (oh, boy), Great Western Trail, The Others Core Box, Mission Red Planet, Lord of the Rings Journeys in Middle Earth.

Quick Tips:

Don't spend a ton of time measuring out your cuts. You don't need to draw out lines either. Just be careful about lining things up, do a small practice line to get a groove, and then do a finished cut with a good amount of force.

Glue a small piece of foamcore under flat cards or carboard player boards. Makes them much easier to get out.

Plan. Plan. Plan. Creating a blueprint for your insert is often one of the trickiest parts of putting together a box. In fact, for Blood Rage and Quest for El Dorado the plan took almost as long as putting everything together. Be meticulous here. Everything should have a place before you glue anything together. 

When planning don't forget to measure the board and rules. You do not want to get everything together only to find out the board sticks up out of the box. Trust me.

When gluing I go a little heavy with big drops and then smear them on the surface with my finger. I find this creates a better seal for the finished product. Just be sure to keep a rag/paper towel handy.

While you can use books to weigh things down, I like to use pins to hold everything together while the foam dries. This largely comes down to personal preference, but I found pins to be a bit tighter and more accurate in the end.

My biggest tip: When cutting pieces, always cut bigger than you need and shave down. This allows you to get a tight fit without too much risk. Going a bit long for walls or cutting wider (and sloppier) for bottoms just to get a smaller piece to work with is extremely useful. I found trying to perfectly measure the first cut leads to issues (and a lot of wasted foamcore). I typically cut a wall about two or three times. It takes longer, but is worth it if you want clean pieces.

"I was going through toys at my parents house for items I wanted to keep and found a lot of unique kids board games from the 90s that I forgot about. A lot of them incorporated new technology at the time. Unfortunately, most of the ones left at my parents house are missing pieces or are outright broken (we were rough on our toys). Now i'm tempted to go looking on ebay, marketplace, and garage sales to see if I can find some of these. I could see a few of these making fun drinking games since they don't rely on heavy thinking. I'm betting these games are why I love modern board games so much. These are what I found:

Snardvark - (timed run from the electronic monster)

Splat - (playdough bug pieces that other players can ""splat"")

It from the Pit- (timed run from the electronic monster)

Clue: The Great Museum Caper - (invisible thief player that steals paintings while avoiding security)
 
13 Dead End Drive - (players kill off other players in order to get the inheritance)

Electronic Mall Madness - (run around a mall to catch sales and make it out with most items) I have heard this board adapts well to zombie games.

Pirates' Gold - (magnetic ships pick up treasure chests in a maze-like sea while avoid the sea monster)

Mystery Mansion Electronic Talking Board Game - (players search miniature furniture for where the inheritance is hidden)

"Hello !  


So I'm backing Aeon's End: Legacy of Gravehold, that's a fact. I have been enjoying the first Aeon's End: Legacy experience fully and had a great experience with it. And I love having some more relaxed legacyesque-solo-able experience that don't take 25min to setup.

Keeping this in mind, I wonder which package to add to my pledge level for the campaign. I quickly snapped for the ""Wave 1"" which is Second Edition + The Depth + The Nameless. But I'm having second thoughts.

What would be the best package within all those ""Waves"" ?

"I think a few of us in Oz will be looking at Game Steward to buy some games that are hard to find locally if you missed a Kickstarter. I recently bought some stuff from them and thought I'd share my experience for others.

Price: bought Honey Buzz Deluxe Version, that version wasn't available locally and retail was still not available. Based on prices I'm seeing online, I paid $100 above the base game retail price to get the extra stuff + shipping. Having said that, this was a relatively light and small package, so shipping will go crazy with larger packages.

Time to Delivery: took exactly a month from the day I made the purchase and arrived at my door. It 10 calendar days from the shipping status to change from 'Received shipping information' to 'In transit to destination'. So hard to tell whether the package was dispatched at any point during those 10 days or if it took them 10 days to get the package picked up.

Having said the above, at the time of purchase, COVID was going wild in the states and it was winter, and some of the worst winter storms were hitting parts of the US. I'm not sure if that contributed to longer shipping times than normal, but they must've been a factor. Mine was shipped with the cheapest postage option. Maybe in normal times you might get your package in like 10 business days or something.

Packaging: It was pretty well packaged, they use bubble wrap where each bubble is like the diameter of our 20 cent coins. The box itself looked fairly banged up, especially the edges, but due to the good packing, all the contents were fine.

Conclusion: Shipping times aside (which again, lots of stuff going on in the US when I bought it so definitely a factor) pretty happy with the results. If the game you want isn't available anywhere but the US, based on my experience, I'd say you can trust them. Might cost you a lot, but at least everything should arrive in good shape.",boardgames,Game Steward Experience (Shipping to Australia)

"Hey fellow boardgamers,

I've been in the hobby since high school, so I've had about 8 years of on and off experience with board games. I've played about 50 different board games and over 500 games of Catan in my life. The collection in the picture has been amassed through this time period but I will admit half of it comes from me hoarding these games during the pandemic. The newest addition is Evolution: Climat and the oldest game is probably the copy of Monopoly I inherited from my cousin. I own about 95% of the games pictured (2 or 3 belongs to friends) and have played &gt;80% of them at least once. We play about 60% of these games regularly. The other 40% isn't as popular mostly because they get too heavy for my group (i.e. Next War) and/or they're too aesthetic for me to part with (On Mars/ Clinic). 

There are some clear themes in my selection. GMT is one of my favorite publishers as I love my historical wargames. With a larger group of friends, though, I will say that Santa Monica, Pipeline, or just endless games of Catan is my favorite way to spend game day. Due to the pandemic, we have had trouble meeting and opening up some of the ones that we haven't played.

Some of the games that are difficult to see in the picture includes Citadel, Bears Vs. Babies, Welcome Back to the Dungeon, the entire Axis and Allies series (condensed into 3 boxes) and Unstable Unicorns. 

As mentioned, I'm quite the hoarder and have a couple of GMT P500 preordered that I cannot wait to get my hands on. I just need to find the shelf space.. or another shelf...

Of the \~55 inserts I've printed for my games, this is easily my favorite.

Also, I want to mention that I love this game. It is so underrated. I've never played the other/older versions of Civilization board games but the Civ: A New Dawn with the Terra Incognita expansion definitely comes closer to the beloved Sid Meier's Civilization PC series. Even the base game is very good but the expansion elevates the game to the next level (great).

"I'll start by saying that I do enjoy Eldritch Horror and Mansions of Madness a lot. I bought every single expansion for those two titles even though some of them remain unplayed due to current obvious reasons.

When I got into the hobby finding stuff for Arkham Horror 2nd Edition was a bit too late and too expensive from where I live. I do own the original though, just never tried any of the expansions. I do enjoy it but found it to be too *sluggish* for my or my group's tastes. I've read that some expansions do solve some of the problems, but I think it's a bit too late for that.

I know all about Arkham Horror: LCG, bought the core set, and Dunwich Legacy w/o Mythos Packs, but I'm somewhat reluctant on starting collecting it since, while it's a very engaging game, it's a huge investment if you want to collect at least the core cycles. Plus, it's also somewhat of a treasure hunt finding and buying older packs today.

So, my question is whether Arkham Horror 3rd Edition is an engaging game and different enough to be enjoyed by someone who doesn't consider himself an Arkham Files devotee even though I do own a lot of those games. Or should I embrace the fact, according to most reviews, that Arkham Horror: LCG is a much more worthy game?",boardgames,Is Arkham Horror 3rd Edition worth checking out?

"[My Shelf](https://imgur.com/a/e2s8CfN)

I know my shelf is less than optimal with the middle bar getting in the way, but it fits so perfectly in the only spot I have to store games. Now that my toddler has taken an interest in my games though, I'll need to figure out a new solution soon.

Most of my board gaming ends up being 2-players with my wife (especially these days), so I generally only buy games that work well with two people. I like to have some games for every occasion though (light to heavy games, party games, etc.). We enjoy heavy games, especially co-ops. Our favourites are probably Mage Knight, Spirit Island, and This War of Mine.

I just picked up Xia and the expansion after trying to get it for years, I've only had the chance to play solo so far but I'm loving it. I also finally found a copy of the Wow Board Game and Shadows of War expansion for a good price. I know it's not the best game, but I played it a lot in college with some friends, and I've really wanted to get it for the nostalgia and to try to get that group back together some day for a game. I find it's biggest flaw is the crazy length and the downtime, so I've added some things to speed it up.

Most of my games have expansions in there, I just don't keep the  boxes (who has space for that?). Except Orleans, since I can't seem to fit it all in one box.

**Games I'll probably get rid of soon**

* Mysterium: Neat concept but I never have the group to play it
* Princes of Florence: 3-player min, never hits the table
* All Creatures Big and Small: Good game, never really want to play anymore
* Thunderstone: Loved it years ago, but never play anymore

One was about racing dachshunds (wiener dogs). It came with these really colorful plastic dogs that you could add length to. The point was to win the race.

"So about 10 years ago I played a game my area's public monthly board game meet up. I played this game that could serve a higher player count. Unfortunately since this was a fairly large meet up that happened I can't even recall who brought the game or who I played the game with. When I went back to college I remember it was simple enough that with some Pandemic pawns and a simulated board I could teach it to my friends...



Alright here's what I remember of this game:
- It played a really high player count, I wanna say 8-10 players
- I believe one player was secretly the spy or traitor or something to that effect
- Every player had a colored pawn on the board but on your turn you didn't need to move your pawn
- the board was a number of houses that looped around, they were numbered 1-10 except for the last house which was the evil house and maybe their was a bonus house that was good... But simple board with 11-12 large spaces
- On your turn I think you could move a pawn the number of spaces that was on the house they stood on...
- Maybe you were scoring points?
- it was an older game so in 2011 I remember thinking the copy I played looked like it was printed in the late 1980s
- The theme was these brightly colored houses that looked early 20th century 
- There might not have been a traitor... In fact I think everyone's color was secret and on your turn you moved any pawn you wanted and it would score the space it landed on...

 So the strategy was to get players to move your pawn to the high scoring spaces while moving other players pawns to the Blackened house

"I had an idea for some Catan rules I'd like to bring to life and a felt this would be a good sub to ask for advice

So my friends and I were playing Settlers of Catan and we started talking about how rng heavy it was and how we could make it more strategic and less luck based. Somebody always seems to get screwed over by the dice and it leaves a salty taste in everyone's mouths afterwards. I had the idea of using dice with a different set of numbers so you could shift the probability in your favor when rolling. I feel this would remain fair because you wouldn't guarantee hitting a specific number and could accidentally end up hitting somebody else's wheat on 9 rather than your stone on 10. I found a good shifted distribution that keeps all numbers possible and leaves 7 as the most likely number for the robber's sake:

Low Roll: 1-1-1-2-4-6 with a standard d6

High Roll: 1-3-5-6-6-6 with a standard d6

The player could choose which set of dice they use before rolling each turn (or potentially pay for the rigged dice with a sheep so sheep actually find a use). I feel that this would offer more strategy around using lower and higher tiles, leaving fewer obsolete spaces and offering the player more choice in the game. As a bonus, if you use the high and low rigged dice together it gives you a 12 in 36 chance of rolling a 7, a 3 in 36 chance for each even number, and a 1 or 2 in 36 for the rest. I like to call it the ""anarchy set"" for those who are desperate to move the robber.

I'd love your guy's opinion on any potential game-play problems I'm being blind to (I do understand the anarchy set is a little out there) or any other changes ya'll know of to make the game less RNG based.

Also does anyone know where could I buy standard pip dice (preferably custom color) with customizable numbers on all sides? I'm having trouble finding anything that's not just ""stick you logo on the 1 face.""",boardgames,I'm trying to re-balance Catan to be less RNG heavy and would like some opinions on my solution

I just fired up Paladins for a solo play through and I think I understand the AI flow. However, first round, the AI kept getting more and more workers. First action Kings Order (fortify), 2nd action pray (I know it doesn't get those workers back), 3rd action commission - took the recruit spot (which instant bonus was 2 workers), 3rd action garrison (which took a gain 1 worker spot), 4th action recruit (got a worker), 5th action commission (which it couldn't get so using the worker track it did pray), 6th action I got tired and cleaned it up, and it still had workers.

Please don't nitpick through and tell me where numbers are wrong bc I might be mixing up one or two actions. But my question is, did the AI just get very lucky in the order of its scheme cards and I should expect this sort of thing? Or, when I got that first ""pray"" scheme card, should I have put a worker in the 'pray' spot on the top left of the AI board? (Thus disabling the AI from getting a 2nd pray action during the round)

Thank you for your time! I really want to like this as it seems like a wonderful engine but I know I will get very bored if the AI is able to get these long loops of actions due to getting so many workers.",boardgames,Paladins of the West Kingdom - solo mode: AI gets lots of workers!

"Hi everyone,

I'd like to reach out for other's experiences with board game apps for iOS, Android or Microsoft Surface tablets 

Ive heard iOS has the best selection of apps, though I have an Android phone and it seems like over the past 5 years Android has been catching up in the number of board game apps. Microsoft surface appears to have a poor selection of board game apps (with the exception of traditional games such as chess, checkers, etc.), though I'd like someone to provide their own experience if I'm wrong.

Is iOS superior from a board game app experience to justify having this be your one iOS device? Or Android/Microsoft tablet users fine with their solutions?

"My brother-in-law and sister have introduced me to Clank! Legacy and I've been greatly enjoying the game.  He was polite and offered me the use of his deck and went with a basic un-modified deck instead, giving himself a handicap of an extra coin to start the game with.  They had already completed the campaign and this is in the post-game scenario with their now permanent changes.

It feels a bit off to me though to have a player so thoroughly handicapped though at the post-campaign mode and am wondering if anyone has any additional insight or experiences to share about playing Clank! Legacy with a potentially rotating group for the post-game.  If, say, I go through the campaign with three players is there a fair way to have built a fourth deck that mimics the average power-gain that the players who actually went through the campaign would have gotten?  How about the Upper-management or C-Team expansion characters?  Is it worth picking one of those up so a ""guest"" could have a better experience while affording the regular group to keep their personalized decks suited to their play-style?

For what it's worth, a number of other members of my group have been incredibly squeamish about legacy games making permanent changes but as the one planning to buy this copy I fully intend to adhere to the rules and properly destroy cards I'm told to.

"There was some hubbub on BGG last week about the depiction of women in games. It seems a common trope to have women in poses to show off their curves while fighting bad guys (obviously the best time to try to please some men.)

\- Too Many Bones

\- Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle Earth (There are lots of cards, so I could be misremembering)

\- Gloomhaven? (I would like to discuss this a bit more I think. I haven't seen all the art, but I remember Childres made a point of changing the art to make women have practical armor.

"Hello, /r/boardgames! 

I took my first hit in January of 2018, with **Ca$h 'n Gun$**. It was recommended by a friend who had passed, and I bought it as a way to remember him. It turned out to be a hit with my game group, but it didn't really spark the ""I need more games"" urge in me. That came a year later when I bought **Lords of Waterdeep**. I had never even heard of ""worker placement"", didn't know what ""Euro"" even meant vis-à-vis a board game, and was confused to find out that a board game had an expansion. 

Since buying LoW, I uh... I kinda got silly with it. I found out that I really like playing new board games. I can't think of which game would be my favorite to play because I enjoy all of them, but the deluxe version of **Bass: Birmingham** is probably my favorite game to *have*. The art is gorgeous, the clay chips are more fun to play with than the cardboard money tokens, and I don't know what it is about black chipboard but *I love it*. Marvel Villainous is probably my least favorite of the bunch. I bought it for my son because he loves Marvel stuff, but I never much cared for the original and the Marvel version didn't change that. 

Here's a list of the games I have in the pipe on KS -

* **Wonderland's War**

"This is my first board game outside of the classics such as monopoly and battleships and all those older games. I've found that if you go first in Dark Edition... you seem to have a huge advantage? This might be the case for all different versions of the game that I haven't played but from what I'm seeing if you go first and start in Tokyo in the 2 player rule set, its very hard to be forced out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Staying in Tokyo has a huge advantage with getting a head start on energy pooling while the other player is trying to roll smashes in an attempt to force a yield before they get too far ahead. Meanwhile, the person in Tokyo that's farming energy can roll for their wickedness / victory points as the other person is trying to roll attacks.

&amp;#x200B;

I played a game where I was unable to enter Tokyo even once due to the other person getting ahead, healing from cards and doing double damage to me. I had to focus on staying alive and at this point it wasn't an option to even try getting them to yield. I played defensively, passively getting victory points with the herbivore card as I knew there was no moving that rock of a player but ultimately died to an attack that did 7 damage.

"I'm looking to set up an after school board game club at the secondary school (Ages 11-18) I will be working at. I'm just wanting to field your suggestions on what games would be good for it.

To help, below I've got some general criteria of games I'm looking for

●Playtime: around 40 minutes to an hour, no longer than 1hr 30 minutes
 ○Even though I'm passionate about the job I do want to ensure myself and students get home at a reasonable time
 ●Considering splitting games into 3 categories based on length and complexity 
   ○Class A: Big games, for students to play they must arrive on time and start setting up quickly
     ●EXAMPLE: Terraforming Mars
   ○Class B: Medium games, still a good experience length good for students who are late or played some Class C games waiting for others
    ●EXAMPLE: Ticket to ride
   ○Class C: Sweet and simple games, can usually go for a couple of replays
    ●EXAMPLE: Coup, Skull
 ○This time should also include time to introduce new players to the game

●Complexity: Being Secondary school, I can not imagine many people being board game hobbyists so games so big complex games with many moving parts may not be appropriate 
 ○Games should be able to be easily explained by the more frequent members of the club
   ●EXAMPLE: Robo Rally, Tsuro 

●Learning element: Being a maths teacher, I can recognise the maths in play with most games and most games have learning elements embedded in theme so games that are good learning tools as well would be helpful
 ○In terms of learning through themeing, the theme itself has to be appropriate. But even better if the theme can include some light role play
  ●EXAMPLE: Pandemic
 ○For learning through mechanics, this can involve any subject not just maths. The example i have is maths based mechanics as it gets students comfortable with using compass directions and construction
   ●EXAMPLE: TREASURE ISLAND

●Social element: Hopefully through this club I can develop student relationships across years and I think this would be best done with games that engage in social interaction, imagination and variety.
 ○Social interactions that can be positive like working as a team or having people word out ideas and discussion
  ●EXAMPLE: Resistance Avalon
 ○Imagination and creativity are also important so games that promote that would be great
  ●EXAMPLE: Dixit
○Variety, I like games that have that one oddball element that allows the game to be more tangible whether it is special dice or restrictions on types of communication
  ●EXAMPLE: Escape, Curse of the temple

●Finally, have to be games are sustainable. As in if I lose a piece or the card gets bent out of shape would that make the game unplayable. Would the cost to replace be negible or would I need to get a whole new copy. Prefer to keep budget sensible. I understand print and plays maybe a good shout

We also recently played Hexplore It: Valley of the Dead King, which involved powering up loads of character stats with 20+ characters to pick from. It's a fun game, but the rules are messy.  
  
Gloomhaven is an example of something with a fun power curve that takes wayyy too long to get into. It takes weeks of sessions to level your character up to 5+, so I'm looking for something that can be done in a single session.

"In the photo, there is one of the oldest games - Mehen. “Egyptian snake game.” 🐍 played between roughly 3100 B.C. and 2300 B.C. A typical Mehen board in the form of the coiled snake came with 3 lion pieces🦁, 3 lionesses, and 6 sets of colored marbles. Archeologists believe that the marbles and the lions were playing pieces and the game was for up to 6 players. 

The rules of Mehen remain unclear, but a game called 'The Hyena Game'🐺 was found being played on a Mehen-type board in Sudan in 1921. 

This is a game for several players. Each player tries to get their main piece to the center and back whereupon their 'hyena' piece is released. The Hyena piece then also travels to the center and back but can terrorize and eat the other player's main pieces on the way. The most modern reconstructions of the Mehen game have used the rules of the Hyena Game as their basis.

What do you think could be the real rules of Mehen? Can you think of any other modern game that has something in common with Mehen?

"One of the reasons I like board games so much is that they offer up a pretty consistent stream of 'aha' moments, where something suddenly comes into focus or a certain mechanic clicks for the first time. 

I've been playing My City, and I'm so impressed by how Knizia modifies a few simple rules and it completely changes your strategy. It's probably one of my favorite things in the hobby to see a robust design get tweaked in lots of different ways. The Arkham Horror LCG does it better than any game I've ever seen, and with amazing thematic effect - just to name one example, the Essex County Express, where&gt;! you're racing to get to the front of a collapsing train!&lt;. Pandemic Legacy S1 (the only one I've played, tho I have Season 0 waiting) was great at this too. Surprisingly, the latest Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective set, the Baker Street Irregulars, has been bending its system in extremely clever ways. &gt;!(We just played the third scenario where you have to frantically track down the file and run all over - and possibly leave! - London)!&lt;

The Exit games are all wonderful in this category too - I keep wondering when they're going to run out of ideas but every game manages to surprise me with something unexpected.

What is your favorite thing to see pulled off in a board game?",boardgames,What is your favorite thing a board game can accomplish?
"So first things first, I'm not a seasoned TTG player by any stretch. I love creative games, and I love strategy (Portal Board Game, anyone?). However, my friends and I all gravitate to one game every time (and yes, we have not yet played Ticket to Ride, so our mainstay may well change).    
    
Basically, I love Monopoly, but eventually everyone gets set in their go-to ""strategy"" and changing things up gets harder to do. So what if color sets weren't all next to each other and Boardwalk and North Carolina weren't always on the same side of the board? I thought about doing a custom square board where every space was printed onto a removable placard that could be placed into a recess on the board, so every game could play differently. I.e., the board itself would be blank, and the normal spaces would be separate pieces that could be placed onto the board in whatever order you like before starting a game.    
    
I came very close to making that, but after discussing it with the boys, I decided to make a Monopoly ""board"" that isn't restricted to the linear, predictable path of the normal square board. I think the general consensus is that much of Monopoly's outcome is defined by the lack of player choice. Players don't have to do much to win. Strategy is sort of an afterthought.    
    
So I created this prototype (https://imgur.com/Xlq8mFv) for a fully modular board. You can have alternate routes. You can have color sets on different sides of the board.    
    
Things to note:    

* When playtesting it, we found that having TOO many options of how to travel across the board means it's incredibly easy to not land on other players' property. This removes incentive to play.    
* It's incredibly easy to buy up all property very quickly in this particular configuration.    
* Defining route of travel is difficult. I DID make little arrows to be placed on spaces to indicate direction of travel but did not employ them in this initial playtest. For the interim, we decided the rule was that you couldn't travel back onto the space you just came from (but you can still travel backwards by going a different route around that space).    
* I think the original Monopoly benefits from its linearity in that it forces players to fall victim to the whims of happenstance.    
* Rules need to be established for how to properly set up the board.    
* There are 2 extra Community Chest and Chance spaces in case they are needed to bridge sections of board.    
* I created new spaces that I'm just calling ""path spaces"" for now. They have different footprints on them (pawprints, tire tracks, etc) and are used to connect parts of the board but do not count as ""spaces,"" in that they don't use up a number on your dice roll.    
* I think more reward and penalty spaces are needed to incentivize travel.    
* I think a rule must be established that only a single entry and exit for the ""GO"" space may exist.    
    
It played a bit poorly and we only did one playthrough and it was very quick and very uninteresting. Gonna tweak things. Some other general info, I spent a combined 5 hours in photoshop making all of the spaces in Photoshop. I spent a combined 5 hours cutting out the original prototype with an X-acto, and another 10-ish hours cutting out the printed pieces and the bits of posterboard that they're adhered to. They are sat on a white corkboard poster with plexiglass on top. Only the board is custom.

"With the expansion, there are 1 of the majority of the park cards, 2 Grand Canyon cards, 2 Yosemite cards, 2 Zion cards, and THREE Arches cards... Meanwhile, there are several parks that were excluded from the game.

"I recently have dug through my old childhood stuff and found a Sailor Moon Official: Web of the Negaverse board game.  Opened once and I think I only played it once.  Everything is in perfect condition including the box. 

I checked ebay and it has sold before for $120 more than once used so I am wondering if it could be worth more than that and how rare it actually is.

I was wondering if anyone has any information that could help me on finding a good home for it.",boardgames,Sailor Moon Board Game
"I'm super disappointed that there's not going to be a second wave late pledge for Lockdown. I get that it's a business decision on their part, and I really don't blame them, but this realistically was the only big box Kickstarter I was going to do this year, so it's still really disappointing. I haven't decided what I'm going to do yet (get base Nemesis now, wait until retail, etc.), so I'm not looking to piggyback right this minute, but just wanted to express my frustration, especially considering I've been waiting \~6 months for the pledge manager to open back up.

"This post is inspired by a game of Spirit Island that happened today, which I’ll share later. But sometimes you are playing a game you expect to take a while but that miracle combo comes up and you get a crushing, decisive victory early. Sometimes so early the table just sits shocked until someone goes “we’ll do we play again?” I want to hear these stories! What was the game and what crazy combo caused it to be so quick?

 Ok so here’s mine from today. Spirit Island, Normally that game takes 1.5- 2 hours for us to play, especially since we just got the Jagged Earth so are still learning the new stuff. I’m playing Fractured Days for the first time, which is a time based spirit that gets the unique ability to foresee card options and choose from them rather than always pulling more randomly. 

During setup, I see one of my major power cards is an insanely powerful option. 8 energy to suck 1 of almost everything into the target land, deal 15 damage, and destroy a bunch of beneficial stuff, and you can permanently lose access to powers to repeat it. So turn 1 I hoard as much energy as I can l, grab that card, and instruct my wife to pick off the two explorers that are out of range. 

Beginning of turn 2 hoard energy again, place a presence so I was in the middle of both boards, play the major power as a swift thanks to my wife, and create two black holes that suck in everything but 1 explorer and wipes the board 99% clean. Then my wife picks off the last explorer.

So that was a turn 2, swift phase, terror level 1 win in just a couple minutes.",boardgames,Share your fastest surprise wins

"The other day I got an email that I had a UPS package coming my way from GMT games, but I couldn't remember buying anything.

It turns out it was a free upgrade pack for 3 games, I can only assume they sent it out to anyone who had a copy of any of those games. For me it was Imperial Struggle.

I remember following the ""living rules"" last summer after the release, and a bunch of the errata due to poor QA on the board and the cards, and I'm glad GMT sent it out for free because it was going to be a huge pain to print out the stickers for the board myself and try to remember certain things about cards. Or worse, have to buy the 2nd printing.

"Just wanted to start a discussion and ask opinions!

So, I buy games both ways - I back KS campaigns and I buy games the normal way.  But I'm curious about the effects of both on sales of the game.

When I buy a game, one of the BIGGEST factors for me is how easy it is to get the *whole* game.  Including bonus content in a Kickstarter is dope, but if I'm buying a game that came out a few years ago, and everyone talks about how good such-and-such KS exclusive was, then I'm probably not going to buy the game at all if I can't find that exclusive somewhere.

(Note: I'm only talking about discrete mechanical elements here.  Any purely aesthetic stuff is nice to have, but won't be a barrier for me to get into the game if I can't find it.  KS-exclusive art or minis or whatever.)

So what I'm wondering is: am I alone?  Like, KS is a great way to get the game initially funded, but do you hurt your long-term sales potential by locking latecomers out of wanting your game?

For example: Eclipse: Second Dawn looks like an *ideal* game for me, and I'm happy to pay $150 for it.  But since I won't be able to get all that cool extra content, I'll always feel like I'm playing an incomplete game.  So I won't even go for it.

The same is true to a certain extent of games with a bonkers amount of expansions already in existence.  I almost didn't get Anachrony for that reason, but they're awesome enough to have a single item that's the base game and all the expansion content.  In general, I'm happy to buy such items!

But if I find great games that are ten years old but are ""complete in the box,"" I just find it so so easy to grab them.

So what are everyone's thoughts?  Does the way KS campaigns work create a buying frenzy in the beginning at the expense of long-term sales/interest?  Or am I in such a minority with my buying habits that I'm not representative?  Would love to hear your views! (And especially if you've been on the other side and have sales anecdotes to share!)",boardgames,"Kickstarter Versus Retail: Barriers to Entry, FOMO, and Long-term Sales?"

So why am I writing about this? Apparently my significant other, the magnificent Instragram boardgamer [@CatsAndMeeples](https://www.instagram.com/catsandmeeples/) had this game sent to her for preview and feedback - but she is no wargamer! So I picked up the reins to try it out since I love WW2 themes.

I played it a few times and wrote some feedback and posted it to BoardGameGeek: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2603847/smart-and-addictive-dueling-game

If you have little time and not enough of it to read my thoughts then I suggest you take a look at the Kickstarter. If you like games like Santorini, RRR or Onitama, then this might truly tickle your fancy. I can't get over how unique and fascinating the core mechanism in this game is.

"I was Eyrie, and my fiancee was Marquise. She's not into heavy board games (I'd classify Root with these two factions as medium, but perhaps heavy leaning when adding in Alliance and Vagabond, idk)

The interplay between factions and characters in just this first game, the Marquise's seeming invulnerability, the complete strategy shift of the Eyrie's Decree system, it's all amazing. 

But the end game is so strong. We were neck and neck the whole time, using completely different strategies, and it could've been anyone's game right up to the last play (She won. She beat me!). The balancing and intricacy is so so so well designed. 

Seriously, I'm always skeptical of hyped games, but Root surpassed even my overblown expectations. If you haven't played it yet, find someone who has it and try it out. Then buy it.

" 

The standard go to for my group is either;

1. Uno - everyone knows how to play it, there is enough screw over someone else to keep it going, we play speed uno too so you have to pay pretty close attention and have good reflexes, it's a good game to get some laughs out of when someone get's stuck with a stack of draw 2's.
2. Sorry - everyone knows how to play, but usually most people end the game angry that they got screwed over so many times or never got any 1's or 2's to even get started.
3. Clue - good guessing game, makes some people a little over confident, and some people are just too good at the deduction, still a nice simple game as long as everyone can agree on the actual rules and not the house rules (One cannot just walk out of and back into the same room, or choose to stay in the room)
4. rummikub - nothing better than rearranging the board for 30 minutes just to be left with 1 tile that doesn't fit anywhere and having to put the whole thing back again.
5. Yahtzee - it's just so easy to travel with this, specially when you can get
6. Euchre - My girlfriends family lives by this game, and I am not exaggerating that statement.

Then there are the games that are just too boring to even bother with, but I still keep them;

1. boggle - I am bad with words and just find it to be a bit of a drag
2. Game of Life - the pure luck of the game makes it very boring in my eyes, I used to LOVE this game, because my ADD self didn't have to pay attention, just spin the dial and move my merry little self along the path.
3. Go for broke - when over half the spaces are blank, you can go a long time without doing anything, roll the dice, move your piece, next person, repeat.  I have actually thought about making my own version of this because I find the concept clever.

Some we get out just for special occasions;

1. gayopoly - just because it's fun, though if I get stuck in the closet, I am for ever there because I don't know ANY of the songs to get back out.  So this usually just sits as a proud back drop on my shelves, that many new comers comment on.

The one's I need to teach my girlfriend so we can play together;

1. backgammon - grew up playing this with my dad a lot and always enjoyed the simplicity but yet the pretty deep strategy involved

"I've had an idea for a board game and I was wondering if it already exists by coincidence, so if anyone reads this and thinks it's familiar, I guess comment letting me know? 

Anyway, so the premise is each player is a trawl fishing company that has to manage it's money to buy fishing boats, dock space, and warehouses. 

Each round the players simultaneously choose where each boat they own will go that round: 

1. Stay in the dock (doing nothing but not costing no upkeep/repairing) 

2. Fishing shallow waters (this is safe but produces low fish) 

3. Fishing deep waters (more likely to get the boat damaged but possibly produces large amounts of fish) 

Perhaps also before fishing commences players can bribe each other to not fish and such because another mechanic is fish population. Where the more the players fish, the lower the population gets and the harder for it to regenerate gets and eventually if they over-fish, there are no fish left.. Or something like that, perhaps there are penalties for this.

"I've been playing modern board games for some time now but I've only recently started to consciously think about this aspect of the games I play. I think playing [Marrakech](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/29223/marrakech/images) repeatedly on Board Game Arena is what really opened my eyes to it. Perhaps I should explain...

So Marrakech is a game that has a very clear random element to the game: it has a roll-and-move mechanism, where the dice dictates whether you move the common salesperson token one (⅙), two (⅓), three (⅓) or four (⅙) spaces around the board before laying a rug next to where it lands. The game is about working around this random element by playing the odds: you have to weigh up the likelihood of landing on your opponents' rugs―forcing you to pay them coins equal to the contiguous area their rugs of the colour landed on covers―against the ability to further extend your own rugs, cover over theirs and the better board position it will afford you with the salesperson: forcing your opponent into your covered areas.

The game works fantastically well in a one-versus-one scenario and it is one of my favourite abstract, two-player games. However in higher player counts I find the game breaks down: too much changes between your turns and it becomes too difficult to make any truly meaningful moves. I.e. the 'entropy' of the game increases with the player count and there is nothing in the game to deal with this.

Now I imagine this is true of most games, regardless of whether there is a clear random element or not: if you have more players doing stuff in a game then, naturally, more stuff is going to change between your turns. But many games manage this by making the turns microscopic or by putting a lot of the action on your own player board where it does not have any impact on the other players.

But there are a lot of games where the action takes place on a central board: Food Chain Magnate and Brass, for example, address this by growing/shrinking the play area so that the actions are spread out over a larger area reducing the 'entropy' in the 'system' as a fraction of the whole. But there are also many games, like Marrakech and Santorini, that don't address this situation at all, and just let the game play differently at different player counts, to the point where they're practically different games.

So I'm interested to know:

* Are there any other games you can think of that deal with this problem, not by growing the play area but in other, clever ways?
* Does it bother anyone else when a game doesn't deal with player count entropy differences?
* Should designers be more aware of this problem and take better steps to deal with it? Is it lazy to just let the games play differently at different player counts?",boardgames,Entropy differences at different player counts

Sure, he’s only in the movie for one song, but you could argue the same for the red queen as she shows up in the original Alice in wonderland in a couple scene max so I think it’s not too much of a stretch.

This kind of objective however seems quite similar to Ursula’s objective to start your turn with Trident and crown in her lair. I want to add so uniqueness. If you have any better ideas I’d love to hear them but this type of objective aligns perfectly with his goal to just be SHINY.
Perhaps to make it different enough from Ursula He needs to have some extra steps. What’s awkward is I feel like Maui and Moana should be defeated to retrieve these artifacts which is AGAIN similar to Ursula having to beat King Triton. Maybe the unique part is that he has to defeat both.

"Introduction:  
So as a hobby I like to world build and for a race, I have in one of my worlds, I created a board game. The rules lead to an extremely open-ended game that seems simple. I wrote a program to play the game using minimax and it can beat me fairly easily, although, this is typically because I blunder. In having this play against itself so many strange non-intuitive moves happen, a lot of them make sense to me but only on a surface level.  
Problem:  
How can I analyze a board game of this complexity in a way that will allow me to better understand what moves should be made and why? I'd essentially like to generalize how the game is played to some extent and give meaning to some of the moves. I have no idea where to even begin in building a thorough understanding though. Part of me worries that it might just be too complex, but I can follow it at times so I'm not so sure. Any idea's on how I might approach this problem?",boardgames,How to Understand a Made-Up Complex Board Game

"I purchased Patchwork for me and my girlfriend to play a couple of months ago. She is not into super thinky games so it seemed like something simple she would enjoy. 

The first two games we played, we did horrible. We both scored negative points. However, we were really enjoying the game. 

I then sat back and wondered how I could do better at the game. I decided that I would try to determine a 'net value' for each of the three available tiles I could purchase. 

I realized that every space moved on the time board could essentially be considered a loss of one button, since each space could have been used as income instead of time to patch the quilt. So if a peice would take 3 time board movements to put on my board, then I would count that as -3 buttons on the net cost. Next, I would multiply the income value of each button by the remaining income spaces I had left to cross on the time board. So if a peice had two buttons on it and I still had to cross 4 income spaces, that would be +8 to the net value of buying that peice. Next I would consider that each square that makes up the peice is preventing -2 points at the end of the game, so I would multiply the number of squares by 2, so if a peice was 4 squares in size then that is +8 in value. Next, the most obvious, I would factor in the cost of the actual price in buttons. So if the cost is 3 buttons, that is -3 buttons on the net value. I would sum these values, in this example we would have -3 + 8 + 8 + -3 = 10 button net value. I would do this for all three peices available to me and purchase the one with the greatest net value. This was incredibly tedious, but it worked. 

My score at the end of this game was around 58. This wasn't fun to play at all though. 

The point of this post is to ask others if you've had an issue like this, where you wish the game didn't essentially boil down to simple arithmetic? If so, did you figure out a solution to this, or do you have a list of games that you've had this issue with that you'd recommend I should avoid? This is really directed at simple 2-4 player games, as I prefer open-information games for solo play or when playing with highly-experienced players.",boardgames,Has anyone else experienced this issue while playing perfectly open-information games that you were hoping would be simple and relaxing?

Hi there I am here to share a game that I have been working on for the past 5 months, and now it is really picking up speed and I and some collaborators are working towards launching a kickstarter campaign in the near future, so I thought REDDIT would be a great place to share some work in progress and get an overall first impression.

# THE GAME

TITLE: Black Horizon: The Card Game(ME)

DESIGNER: William Bang (ME)

GENRE: Deckbuilding Card Game

PLAYERS: 2-4 people

DURATION: 30-90 Minutes.

RELEASE YEAR: Q4 2021 (we hope)

KICKSTARTER Q2 2021 (we hope)

PRODUCTION: CRITICAL GIANTS (My company)

PUBLICATION: CRITICAL GIANTS

&amp;#x200B;

# THE PITCH

In Black Horizon you control 3 planets with health, these you protect and killing the opponents planets is the path to victory.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bqr466n39pk61.jpg?width=6000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42e4b193a5182114a5910952ae6df683d3709f19

*Processing img p183njr29pk61...*

&amp;#x200B;

Inspired by other deckbuilding games, in black horizon you start play with a starting deck of 10 cards, containing resources and attack power, throughout play you will draw from your deck, play cards from hand, and acquire new cards from the trade row to strengthen your galactic empire (Your deck) 

There are 4 card types in black horizon: ships, stations, traps and actions. 

* Ships stay on the battlefield until destroyed and usually attack your opponents planets and units. 
* Stations also stay on the battlefield but take up special spots, these have defence like planets and ships, but usually provides strategic abilites for the players fleet. 
* Traps take up the same kinds of slots as stations, but they are revealed and played when the opponent takes a specific action.
* Actions are the most common cards in the game, they off one time effects before they return to your deck and repeating the cycle.

What makes Black Horizon different is the 3 planets you control. Every round you will have to choose a planet to be your active ""system"" in this round, which means that is where you play ships, attack with ships, launch stations from that round. (Unless you have special effects that let you do otherwise)

This we have found to put a big emphasis on choice during gameplay, where in deckbuilding games the choice lies in buying the cards and seeing them unfold. Buying the cards is still a mayor component, but how you play based on the cards given to you makes a big difference, when you have multiple planets to choose from each with it's own ability, health and flavor. 

# NOTABLE EFFECTS

Through playtesting one the more intersting effects of the game is warping, warping let's you move a ship to another planet, in itself doesn't seem that interesting, but combined with ships or cards that gives you special abilites when doing feels quite excting, building the right strategy around such abilites feels rewarding and it gives you strong hints of combining cards in Magic and Hearthstone, similarly we have effects like spend and siphon that let's you drain resources or health to perform powerful actions. Building a deck suited to deal with those abilites also feels quite rewarding and can be punishing if your deck is out of sync. 

We believe the game is fast to get into and will take time to master :)

# THE ART

As a visial development studio and concept artist/ illustrator myself, the art and feel of the theme is something we strive for and something we want to make grand. We will produce all the art ourselves, and there is a heap of it, but we are excited. Here are some work in progress cards.

3: Players have cards in their hand and face up cards on the table?
4: I think you can pick up or swap cards in some fashion
5: The goal was either to have a higher total than the table but less than your opponent, or to have less than what's on the table but more than you're opponent

All right.  So I’ve been working on a project regarding a dead game for well over a year now (game in question is the super short lived Pokémon Trading Figure Game)

One of the reasons why the game released 1 1/3 sets is because the bases were super fragile and the pins would easily break off.   Or the figures themselves would break.

In this, I’m focusing on the bases.

I want to commission somewhere local to get the bases done in a stronger plastic.
I tried researching different plastics.   With limited research, I landed on UHMW for being super durable as well as having low friction (which is good because the figures for this game are required to physically spin).  

The part I’m not sure about is...what do I do from here?

I need about 50 bases and about 30 of a separate piece.
Would I need to go to an engineering consultant before I start shopping around?   Do I just show up to any local shop willing to work with this sort of odd request?

Are there other durable and low friction plastics worth looking at?

I remember in a recent video I watched, Quinns from SUSD had talked about how many times when you first start out gaming, you feel the need to really sink your teeth into every meaty Euro you can get your hands on. This was true for me, I was buying every Euro I could buy that was beloved... TM, Concordia, Tzolkin, Orleans, Feast for Odin, CoB, LoW, Lorenzo, GP, TMars... and it's not that I don't like those games, because I love them... but I have found that I really want an experience. Highly thematic games that also offer some really interesting decisions, games that months later... we still talk about ""that one time"".

- The first time each player's frog ambassador visits/reveal any River Locations, they do not get any bonus pearls, but get to choose which River Location cards to play and earns one bonus coin/point. Caveat: once the player chooses the card, it will be revealed for all players and the chosen card will be tagged to that location for the rest of the game. 


Rationale:


We found that the face down River Cards being too swingy. On the other hand, at two players, having four free pearls available inflated the pearl supply, and made the Shoal location a relatively unappealing location.
 

This variant gives the earlier players who visit the River Locations more choices for their preferred cards (first mover advantage), yet the laggards get perfect information for what are required to fulfil the cards once they are revealed.


It also scales well from two to five players. At five player count, it gets more competitive, but also makes the Shoal location an appealing target. The Shoal visitor won't feel handicapped by the lack of free pearls.


Not having bonus pearls will also lock all players to equally be able to gain a maximum of 4 Pearls in total (as compared to the theoretical maximum of 8). This makes the game tight enough to consider if it is worth it to pursue the most expensive Wonder, or to spend two pearls on two adornments. 



Gameplay Experience 


In my experience, at two player games, there are times where only two River Locations are revealed the entire game, and that's fine. 


Exploring more locations is a risk (ties in thematically) but is rewarded with a bonus point. 


At two-three players, it is beneficial if the player can remember the rest of the cards when they first look through them, as they can decide if they fulfil the criteria to uncover other River Locations. 


Uncovering River Locations also becomes a pseudo mini Basic Event as we get rewarded with one bonus point/ coin for doing so.",boardgames,Everdell Pearlbrook: River Location variant

"I recently decided I wanted to get my first game bag for transporting my board games. I’m currently borrowing a bag that isn’t large enough for some of my games, and is open-topped leaving my games exposed to the elements. After doing some research, the bag that I think will best suit my needs is a Rothco Canvas Parachute Cargo Bag. It is large enough to transport any game currently in my collection or that I anticipate adding in the future (24x15x13 inches according to Amazon), reportedly is well-made, has plenty of good reviews, and is affordably priced. 

There is one issue I am running into with it: a shoulder strap. The bag comes stock with 2 handles, in essence you would carry it like a briefcase or duffel bag. This isn’t a dealbreaker for me, but I would prefer to have a shoulder strap to make carrying games easier. Reviews from board gaming websites are giving me the impression that it is possible to add a shoulder strap to this bag, but I can’t find any more information other than it being alluded to that it’s possible. I have seen on Amazon some users saying you can add a strap, some saying you can’t. So my question is: does anybody here have this bag, or know somebody who does? If so, is adding a shoulder strap possible? If it is, how? Are there areas you can clip each end of a strap to, would I have to sew a strap onto the bag, or some other method? Also, would you mind giving me some recommendations on shoulder straps you’ve had success with / think would do the job well if it is possible?

The type of shoulder strap I have in mind would be something heavy duty and comfortable if possible because it will likely be carrying a fair amount of weight on board game night.

Any advice, recommendations, or information in general is welcome, even if it is a recommendation on a different bag entirely. This bag checks almost all of my boxes, the only things that are cons for me are the fact it’s not waterproof and the fact it doesn’t come stock with a shoulder strap. If there is a solution to the shoulder strap problem I will likely order it immediately, as I don’t anticipate it being exposed to the weather for long periods of time.

I also have another question, slightly off-topic: does anybody have a good method for waterproofing game-bags? If there’s something I can do to protect my board games further I’m open to it, especially if there is some chemical I can apply to the bag to make it water repellant or something like that.

"Super fun game, I'm really enjoying it! I love logic puzzles and games, whether board games or pencil and paper. My only complaint is that it's just a bit too easy for seasoned logic puzzle enthusiasts. I know that they include the option to start out with the doom token closer to the finish, and that's a perfectly fine way to increase the difficulty, but it doesn't really increase the complexity. It's like making a boss fight in a video game harder by increasing the boss's hitpoints, rather than modifying the mechanics of the fight itself.

I understand of course that when you make a game, you want it to be enjoyable for players of all experience levels, so this is not a critique of the existing game per se, but rather it is a hope that they will release an advanced version of the game, intended for audiences looking for something a little more sophisticated. From a business perspective, this would of course come with a smaller target demographic, but I for one would be willing to pay a higher price to account for what will probably be decreased sales numbers.

For example, another of my favorite logic games, [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game\)), came out with an advanced version named Super Mastermind. In the original there were 4 peg slots and 6 peg colors, while in Super Mastermind they increased it to 5 peg slots and 8 peg colors. With these additions, they increased the complexity of the core logic. Doing it this way heightened the challenge in a way that made it more enjoyable and satisfying than if they had simply reduced the number of guesses you could make before you lose.

I think a good enhancement would be to increase the maximum value on fate tokens from 7 to 9. I kind of suspect they may have tinkered with this during the development process, before deciding 7 would be the best balance for all players. The 1, 2, and 3 tokens all have one pip each, and the 4, 5, and 6 tokens all have two pips each. The 7 token is the only one with three pips, so this leads me to believe there may have, in early stages, been an 8 and 9 token, both of which would also have had 3 pips. There would of course also need to be balance changes made to the cards themselves, which were designed for a 7 fate game, but that doesn't seem like it would be too difficult.

That said, even the current version is still really great. I had wanted to order it years ago, but they were out of stock by the time I got around to ordering it, and when I saw they had finally got more in stock, I made sure not to wait this time, lest I miss out again.",boardgames,"I just picked up ""The Shipwreck Arcana"" by Meromorph Games."

Alternative uses for the Locoweed plant are gaining traction in the medical community of Quedlinburg. Previously understood to be little more than an annoyance, popping up where it was least wanted and doing more harm than good, new developments have proven the Locus Fern to be a potent and inexpensive replacement for many medicinal herbs. Many of Quedlinburg's top physicians who previously scorned the plant as insignificant or even dangerous have recognized the economic potential of harnessing the species for human consumption. The coming days are uncertain for the future of the Locoweed, but only time will tell whether it is a miracle cure or just a flash in the pot.

EXTRA LOCO is a fan-made expansion for the Quacks of Quedlinburg and its first expansion, the Herb Witches. No additional rules or modules have been added; instead, a variety of new ingredient books for you and your fellow players to explore.

"Like many of you I enjoy tracking my plays and looking at statistics. Some of you use spreadsheets, some BoardGameGeek and some such as myself use apps. For the last 4 years or so I've been using BG Stats. It's a fine app, but I felt it was lacking in some key areas; most notably more complex scoresheets and expansion plays.

So I decided to solve this problem by developing my own app.

**Introducing [Board Record!](https://i.imgur.com/lb5giwU.png)**

It's currently Android only and in beta. Feel free to jump right over to the **[Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trafford.boardrecord)** page and try it out.   
  
It has all the standard features such a tracking your collection, recording plays/players and locations and syncing with **BoardGameGeek**. These are all free to use, as are the features described below.  
  
[Scoresheets](https://i.imgur.com/aEy0s9y.png)

The main feature of Board Record is scoresheets. This was somewhat inspired by ScorePal, however I felt it was rather clunky and lacking in the stats department. Board Record allows you to create ""rounds"" for games which can be an actual round like in Jaipur or a ""scoring category"" like in 7 wonders. With this you can view stats on a per round basis rather than just by total scores.

[Per round stats.](https://i.imgur.com/2ykmNTC.png)

The other main feature is expansion plays. While BG Stats allowed me to enter a text entry for ""variant"" on plays, it did nothing with this value and had no real concept of expansions. In Board Record when you select an expansion it links to an actual game and when you view stats for that game it will include all plays for which it was used as an expansion. You can even log these plays to BGG as a 0 qty play. Filtering and comparing stats by expansions used is a planned feature.

[Tags](https://i.imgur.com/w8THNw8.png)

I've also implemented a tag system for plays which can be used to visualise any additional data you like. For example I use it to record how a game of Spirit Island ended (Terror I, Terror II, Terror III, Fear for wins and Blight, Spirit Death and Time for losses).


Some other features of interest.   
It has a random start player picker. I've always been interesting in how often the start player wins in games,but I often found myself forgetting to record you went first. In Board Record since I now use the app to decide who goes first, it automatically records it.    

It has a [Game Picker](https://i.imgur.com/ZPV2vMH.png) which can randomly select a game to play based on filter criteria such as player count and duration.


There is a premium version, currently this doesn't do much more than remove the ads (which are pretty unobtrusive, no full screen or timed ones). But I do plan on adding some additional features and stat filtering to premium. Until then, it's half price.  I will also be giving out some codes to commenters here to unlock it for free.

So please try it out and don't hesitate to let me know of any issues or if you have any suggestions.

**Thanks**",boardgames,Board Record BETA - New play tracking and statistics app.

"So my girlfriend is very smart, and she has the capability to learn quickly and pick up some heavier games, BUT I only have a small window in which to win her over. She clearly gets anxiety over the idea of learning a new game through fear of feeling stupid and not understanding it.  I've tried to convince her that learning the game can be part of the fun/experience, and the first game doesn't have to be perfect, but she hates to feel like she doesn't understand something and really suffers from fear of inadequacy. I have a window of about 20-30 minutes and if I can't get the game to click with her, she'll start to become disinterested. 

Some of this may be obvious, but I've slowly started to learn a few things:


1. Get her to watch a 'watch it played' video in her own time - this worked with Brass Birmingham, as she felt like she was almost teaching me the game, pointing out things she remembered from the video. She took ownership of her own learning and I think she enjoyed that.


2. Pick games with theme! - I was amazed at how quickly she became invested in and learned Robinson Crusoe, because everything just made logical sense and was exciting to her. It made the game FAR less intimidating. Also helped that it was co-op, so she was losing WITH me, not against me.


3. Contextualise everything! - Troyes was a nightmare. If it wasn't my Birthday she would have given up. She couldn't get over the fact it was just dice on a flat board and places to put stuff and numbers that do things UNTIL it finally clicked that the dice are people building/defending the city, and you are 'recruiting' them for your cause. And we have to defend the city every round before we start building. Etc. Once she had a story, everything fell into place. (Absolutely incredible game by the way)


4. Focus on playing the same game several times instead of starting a new game every week. - when initially getting into this hobby I did the usual thing and bought quite a few games straight away and wanted to play them all. I quickly realised that a new game every week was stressing her out and we played far more by sticking with one game for a few weeks, because she was excited to play it and didn't feel anxious. Then she was less stressed on the occasions I DID introduce a new, heavier game.


5. Lastly, play lighter games too. - I'm super excited to play On Mars, but there's a time and a place. Not every day has to be spirit island or Barrage. It can be exhausting. Play some patchwork (or Paris: la cite, which is my new favourite)

"So, we’re arguing over how harmony tokens work.
The rules are every opponent whose active race was not attacked receives a harmony token.

Friend A (pandaran) says that if you dont have an active race I “did not attack an active race” and so you receive a harmony token.

Friend B says “because my race is in decline, i am not an active race thus immune from gaining harmony tokens”

"So I got Bohnanza today as it's a classic and I love these types of little card games. The game seems pretty neat but the rulebook in my opinion is not that great.

I tried to play the 2p variant ""which is just like the variant rules for 3 players with these changes...which is just like the standard game rules with these changes..."". This kind of structure for a rulebook leads to some confusion. 

If just going by the rulebook, trading should still happen in a 2 player game although I'm seeing online that the 2p variant does not have trading? 

Also, from rules videos I watched it seems there used to be a mechanic for buying a 3rd field but that was nowhere to be found in these rules so I'm assuming that mechanic was cut from the game and you either just have 2 or 3 fields depending on player count. 

And for the 3-7p variant, I guess I'm a little confused why this isn't just called a 5-7p variant? Like is this the preferred way to play for 3-5p as well once you know the game or is it just an alternative way to play it?

"I hope everyone will excuse the two posts about the same thing in the same month here, but I'm hyped beyond belief for this and I think the finals are a big enough event to justify it!

&amp;nbsp;

Two weeks ago, I posted here about the Diplomacy Broadcast Network Invitational; a tournament where the 28 highest ranked Diplomacy players in the world (by DBNI ranking) were invited to face off against one another. If you want to, you can read that post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/likfqn/dbni_the_worlds_top_28_diplomacy_players_are/) - it goes into a bit more detail on what Diplomacy is, and why it's a board game that works so well at a competitive level.

&amp;nbsp;

Tl;dr of that post though - this is the most exciting event of the year, and very possibly of all time, in the Diplomacy hobby. Bringing together this many of the world's top ranked players is unprecedented, and it's being accompanied by the esports-style coverage that's emerged over the past year.

&amp;nbsp;

This is doubly exciting for me, because I qualified for it! Literally by the skin of my teeth; I'm ranked 30th, but six of the top 28 couldn't attend or didn't want to, so the invitations were extended a little further down. Being one of the lowest seeds, I also didn't get my first choice of rounds to play in, so I ended up having to play in both round 1 and round 2 - meaning I was playing Diplomacy from 3pm until 7am the following day, with a two hour break in the middle.

&amp;nbsp;

I was honestly just stoked to have qualified, and didn't expect to make it to finals. I had an okayish round 1, but I really gave it my all in Round 2 and came out with a solo victory, something that's extremely rare in these games! It earned me enough points not only to qualify for the Grand Final, but to qualify in first place as well!

&amp;nbsp;

The final is in 'Top Board' style, which means it's winner takes all - the game has no time limit, and will go until either one player reaches 18 SCs, or until every other player concedes to the player leading on SC count. It's expected to last **6-12 hours** but could feasibly go on much longer if it's a close run thing. It starts at 8pm my time, so I'm preparing for a long night.

"My partner and I had been eyeing Spirit Island for a while, and there's only so many rounds of Raptor or Ascension one can play without getting tired so we finally picked it up!

The game is a blast, though my partner is hesitant to move to higher difficulty. We're paying 2p without the Adversaries so far, while they stick to the simpler characters and I try out the more complex. I love the variety between the games, but we'll need to step up the challenge next game as we are consistently winning to Terror Level 3 progression.

That being said, one frustrating aspect of the game has been the component quality. I purchased the game for $80 from my FLGS to support them instead of $52 on Amazon, and I guess I expected more out of a game with such a high MSRP. We live in Colorado, where we have practically no humidity, and the boards came pre-warped! After some sessions underneath the in-laws' encyclopediae, they were fine for a bit but quickly warped again. Our two player island is shaped like a seesaw where it should connect. One of the boards even has a bent pointy end despite being a brand new purchase.

Worse than the game boards themselves is the Phase board, which appears that it may never lay flat. I saw some mentions of removing the flash/extra cardboard from the seam and tried that to no avail. Our Dahan tokens came pockmarked with little blemishes on their roofs. The plastic components are in fine condition, though the Blight token is annoyingly stout and doesn't actually resemble the Blight icon on cards.

Finally, this might be the worst box for actual game storage we own. Putting everything back in is a big pain and the lid does not close fully. I'll definitely have to have a friend print some storage solutions for it.

These issues aside, it is very fun, and we're going to try it out tomorrow evening as 4p for the first time! I live the ""overgrowth"" spirit and my partner enjoys the ""lightningbird"" most. I'm just curious if anyone has clever additions to their copy or fixes for the boards, because damn.",boardgames,Recently picked up Spirit Island; loving it but what's with the component quality?
"Player A, B and C are playing a boardgame game. The board game is played across 4 rounds and is a worker placement game (each player has an equal amount of figures they can place each round). In the 4th round, each player has 5 figures to play.

In this game, player A and Player B were neck and neck, but by the end of the game, player A won. After the game, player B realised that he only played with 4 figures while everyone else played with 5. All players have played the game before and are experienced, but it was an oversight as the game is tense and requires a lot of strategic thinking. Player B was focused on in-game strategizing that he overlooked he only had 4 figures. 

Player B suggested that we recall the match because he made a mistake and played at a disadvantage (playing one figure less is significant and breaks the balance of the game) . Player A insisted that he won fair and square because player B made the mistake of not realising the amount of figures he had. Player C agreed with player B, and argued that the match was null and void because it was not played according to the rules. The rulebook clearly says that the round is only over when a player has placed all their figures. One player did not place all their figures, and so the end of the game was called early. Player C thus alleged that the game should be recalled because it is everyone's responsibility (not just player B) to make sure the game is being played fairly and in accordance with the rules. Additionally, because players A and C had an inherent procedural advantage over player B,  it was no longer an equal playing field.

 Player A remained insistent that it was Player Bs fault that he played at a disadvantage making it impossible for himself to win - and because of that he should be allowed to keep his win fair and square. He argues that to claim otherwise is 'hiding your mistake behind the rulebook', and that the winner should not be penalized because Player B made a mistake. He claims there's no difference with this sort of mistake and making strategically bad decisions in the game. Player C claims there is a difference as this particular error meant we were not playing according to the rules of the game.

"We recently tried to find a cooperative 2 player card game. To my surprise there weren't as many options as I hoped for and ""Shamus"" wasn't quite what we were looking for.

So we decided to make our own. Our goal was  to allow players discussing strategy, simple rules, and quick gameplay, while still being challenging and fun. We now played this on a daily base for the last week. After some revisions I feel confident enough to share the ruleset we came up with. Feedback encouraged:

&amp;#x200B;

# CoRoS

is a coop card game for 2 players, meaning the players work towards a common goal. At every point in the game players are allowed to talk about what cards they have, what to play next and strategy in general. However showing your cards to the other player is not allowed.

**Setup**

Shuffle a standard playing deck of 52 cards. Each player is dealt 8 cards. The remaining cards are placed face down between the players forming the stock. Turn over the top card of the stock and place it next to the stock, this is the discard pile.

**Start**

It is up to the players to decide who will start. Every player also has to choose 1 of 2 roles, the role determines the cards the player will be allowed to play for the rest of the game:

* Suits Role
* Rank Role

|to play a card:|
|:-|
|The player places a card from their hand onto the discard pile. This is only allowed if rank/suits (depending on the players role) between the top card of the discard pile and the played card match.|

**Move**

Moves alternate between the players. Every move follows this pattern:

1. The player can play a card, ending their move by doing so.
2. If the player cannot or doesn't want to play a card they have to place the top card of the stock face up onto the discard pile. Then the player is allowed to play a card, ending their move by doing so.
3. If the player still cannot or doesn't want to do play a card they have to draw one card from the stock. After drawing they are allowed to swap one card with the other player, before ending their turn.

**Goal**

The game is completed as soon as either one of the players plays their last card. If the number of cards in the other players hand is below 5 the game is won.

If a player has to draw a card, but the stock is empty the game is lost.",boardgames,cooperative card game using a standard playing card deck

"I recently backed the Kickstarter DEFCON 1, which is a 2-5 player Cold War game in which what you’re allowed to do changes rapidly with the defcon level, eventually devolving into lobbing nukes at each other. I managed to find another English speaking player to try it out on Tabletopia, and even had a designer help me out with all the rules! (The rulebook is currently a draft, and the Tabletopia is in French, which makes it a little confusing, but the design team is fantastic in their community work and cleared up the rules).

It’s worth noting that we probably messed up a decent amount of rules, but we were consistent in our rulings, and we had a blast.

Going in, both me and my Soviet opponent figured this would just be an intro game that showed the promise, but wouldn’t be able to fully deliver due to it being 2 players in a 5 player game. We were dead wrong.

The gameplay was an incredibly tight experience, where you felt the need to try and counter every little move your opponent did. This resulted in some (unneeded) show of force in Algeria and the east Atlantic early game, leaving us staring each other down and eventually sinking each other’s ships. The early game is surprising akin to a worker placement game. Since you can’t invade core territory at higher defcon levels, you’re left to sway nations diplomatically. You COULD fight each other outside your territory, but that would destroy units that could be moved to change diplomatic scenery.

We dropped the defcon to 3 pretty quickly, but we suddenly halted our aggressive expansion with little reason. We both had the means and the resources to make big plays, but we didn’t want to be the guy who kicked it all off. I was finally able to fire off a mission card (a surprisingly fun way to do mini objectives) that blockaded east Germany and turned it to NATO control, dropping us to defcon 2 and starting the war.

And the war was shocking. Combat is incredibly easy, with level 3 beating level 2, and level 2 beating level 1. Western Europe become a gridlock, but I was able to push my units through the weakly defended Siberia and eventually north from Turkey, aiming to take Moscow. I was in good position to win, until a smart use of missile launchers destroyed my western line and left Europe vulnerable. We dropped to Defcon 1, and nukes were now available.

I can’t even begin to describe the dread my opponent and I felt finally reaching this phase. Even though the nukes seemed easy and fun to use, we just... didn’t want to. Because us being able to inflict heavy losses meant is TAKING heavy losses. But by this point, Soviet tanks were steamrolling Europe and had to be stopped. So with a bit of fitting irony, they first NATO nuke to be launched destroyed West Germany.

The game was coming to a head. Central Europe was a nuclear wasteland. While I’d lost almost all of Europe, I’d taken Moscow and destroyed all but two of his divisions. With no factories left to deploy units, he was done for. I just had to take back Germany and I’d win.

And then I lost.

My initial success in the North Atlantic had faded, with my loss of 2 carriers to his frigates and submarines. I had the forces to retake it, but I didn’t want to risk losing them again. But his naval control meant he was able to redeploy his ground units overseas to England. He’d captured his final objectives. I had lost.

The game was brilliant. The gameplay changed dramatically from defcon to defcon, and the finale was a bitter fight over the scraps that made us curse nuclear weapons even as we used them. The gameplay was also simple and yet invigorating. It’s also worth noting that I didn’t use a single narrative flourish to make the story sound more interesting. Rocket attacks, fast moving tanks, and submarine warfare were just part of the things that made combat feel fresh. I left out my use of MK-Ultra to weaken his units, his use of nuke-proof tanks to pin down units in Siberia, and both of our uses of satellites to gain tactical options. It’s just so thematic, without adding extra complexity. 

I do have a couple issues worth mentioning. Firstly, the draft rulebook is outdated and a bit confusing, and I would really like there to be more to it. Secondly, we played over Tabletopia, which was woefully clunky. The French language on the board also made us go to translate a card once or twice, but it was still usually clear through artwork or some key words what it wanted. 

I can’t say how well it works at higher player counts, but I will say that there were large chunks of the board that were not used, and could very well allow it to be played at higher counts without horrid overcrowding. But I absolutely recommend Defcon 1 at 2 players.

"Hello,

\#### reason #####

I have big dilemma. What I lack in my game collection is a game that is in the style of preferably Lovecraft (any other theme that is somewhat dark would suffice) and feels like an adventure. However there are a lot of factors that make the choice hard.

\#### Eldritch Horror #####

I owned EH previously. I hated it. I hated it not necessarily because it was random but because the randomness made the choices not significant. What I mean is that being good at this game is just knowing the game - I don't think you get better at the game. You know the game better. You don't get good at it like a chess player in game. You just know possible outcomes and choose the move that seem to move you towards solving a mystery. I don't necessarily search to get the best at some game - I like if game allows for being skilled player. Otherwise I feel like the game plays me rather than me playing the game.

Why did I buy it? I watched FFG overview and it looked as something very very interesting. The overview still looks great to me today... so it visually and as an idea of adventure is very appealing. I also like it being a sandbox experience. The gameplay however... yep.

Why do I consider it again? I like the LCG. It gives me a lot of visual appeal of EH but provides gameplay where it is still a lot of random situation but I have much more control over what happens. I could see that quite often there is more than 1 move to consider. I think it definitely have much more place for being better player. So... I'm dead tired sometimes and I just lack the mental strength to get into scenario-based game. Sometimes I'm too tired to think. I'm just wondering if that's not the time to just have eldritch for a day like that.

\#### Machina Arcana ####

Here Machina Arcana comes into play. It is visually very appealing. It has more meaningful gameplay. The scenarios to play seem to me more sandboxy than other scenariobased games.

It is definitely harder than EH (at least from the materials I watched) . It seems like sweet spot for me in terms of mixing randomness and being good at the game.

So far so good... but.... Scenarios seem to be long and opinions of game time are not consistent. People sometimes mention 90 min, sometimes 6-8 hours (?). I know this may very between scenarios but it seems too swingy.

The event/horror/whatever  those cards are called that shows what happens in one of the phases comes down 'how to modify monster/abilities to fight'. In ED there are different events. I like the idea that EH does here (meeting someone, doing a pact etc). However it still boils down to do the strength/whatever test.

I'm also not a fan of tactical games. It seems like it's nice in MA but distance/positioning between things having huge role in combat is not my thing. I don't dislike it but I always liked card combat mechanics in games (MTG, W40k LCG etc).

Random thought - I kind of like Relic. Kind of. It is too random but I did see at least some decisions being meaningful regarding moving inside (timing wise).

\#### Other games ####

Why not other games?

Arkham3 - feels like worse LCG. I Also don't like the visuals of the board.

Runebound - Terrinoth is a little too cartoony.

Mage knight - Well... Maybe I will give it a shot if I don't buy either of ED or MA.

AH final hour - I bought it . Haven't played it yet. Seems different enough to leave it out of the topic.

Pandemic - I have Cthulhu version. However I don't like pandemic. Nothing really against it - I just don't enjoy playing it.

\#### Games that I like / don't like ####

What I like? Most of the times non-adventure games. That's why I feel the need of having more of them (I have mentioned Relic, AH LCG, AH final hour, pandemic if it counts as adventure game).

Most of the games that I enjoy: MTG, RFTG, Broom Service, Abyss, Istambul, AH LCG

Kind of like: Warhammer 40k LCG, 51 state, Metallum, Relic, Patchwork, Rising sun

I don't like - Keyforge (feels gameplaywise like worse MTG, don't like the theme also), , Pandemic, 7 Wonders duel (same like pandemic - nothing against it but not enjoying it somehow), Star realms/Cthulhu realms (too easy, too obvious moves), Nemesis (I couldn't get into theme. Didn't like the gameplay but I cannot pinpoint why as I played it just once or twice long time ago and cannot recall mechanics.).",boardgames,Eldritch Horror vs Machina Arcana

Cheers!",boardgames,"Most simple, awesome game you've played"
"Tip first details later...

Teach it first to a child, then your group. If you can teach it to a child (assuming they are willing) then you can teach it to anyone.

Details below. 

So I’m the guy in my gaming group who buys all the games in my group and teaches them. I actually enjoy the learning of the rule book, play through solo, watching the tutorial videos, play throughs etc. I put in a lot of work to make sure the teach is perfect. 

But...I have the oddest group of people to teach, think all extremes mixed into every person (in laws and my kids mainly, wish I could meet fellow gamers). You can read the description of the group members below after I explain the teaching to the child.

I have a 5 year old girl (intellectually about 8 so I would say choose an 8 year old) who shares my knack for board games. When I have a new game to teach, I unbox it with her, explain the components and start the setup. 

Then I teach the objective, I ask her to restate the win condition and we begin. 

Every time I introduce a mechanism or she takes a turn, I tell her why and ask her again for the purpose of the mechanic (if there is a theme, I make a tie in to the theme). 

I ask how the mechanism contributes to the win condition. I ask her to repeat it (briefly in a fun way).

As we play each turn in a learn as you go fashion I’m constantly restating mechanisms, how they contribute to winning etc and just summarizing over and over. 

Sure she has hiccups where she loses focus or wants to do what’s naturally fun or fiddle with a meeple or something, but that’s what adults do! 

Before you know it, she learns the game, actually has fun playing it, spends time with her dad and feels the satisfaction of learning.

Main concept of this teaching, start small, use teaching of win objective and mechanisms to “scaffold” an individuals mental reasoning of why they do what they do and have them say it out loud. It confirms what you said makes sense, builds their confidence, and further helps you remember everything you are teaching.

In the end, you’ve taught someone with a naturally low attention span and lower intelligence than most adults, so you can teach any adult anything. 

It is not as much work as it sounds, and you can condense the teach to suite your group.

I started with her with Ticket to ride first journey, went up to last defense, then Graduated to splendor, sagrada, and now even wingspan (she is way too young to build the engine properly but gets the turns and rules and is thinking three turns ahead)

To prove how well this works I’ll describe her board game characteristics as well as the group I teach these games to.

"The premise of the game is that you build your spaceship over the course of the game using resources. You could also do missions through the game that take certain resources, and if successful, might give you a bonus or more resources or something like that. You could also pool resources for a mission with another player, and work out how to split the reward once completed.

You had to collect some resources to defeat the boss at the end (the game was coop) and if you didn’t you had to go exploring more.

"I read the rules for Brass: Birmingham, watched some videos, and checked out the forums on BGG. Despite all this, during my first play with my son we made a ton of mistakes and had a bunch of questions. So, I did some more research and learned:

1. If you take coal or iron from another player it’s free.
2. You can build in any city as long as you have that location card and the resources to do so (e.g., cash and iron). It does not need to be connected to anything.
3. You can use a wild location card to build in an area that doesn’t have a location card for it (&lt;4 players).
4. Industry cards can only be used in locations that are part of your network (i.e., have one of your link tiles adjacent to them).
5. You don’t get the VP points when a tile is flipped, but rather at the end of the era. So, if you overbuild your own flipped tile you’ll lose the previous tile’s VPs. 
6. When you place a coal or iron tile and there are openings in the corresponding market, you *sell* your cubes to it at the market rate. So, you can actually recover some of the cost of building an iron or coal tile if there are corresponding openings in the market. 
7. You can only place link tiles in your network (i.e., adjacent to a city in which you have an industry tile or another link tile connected to it).
8. You do not need to be connected to your own beer to consume it, but you do need to be connected to consume someone else’s beer.

"I’m a librarian, and I’m looking to invest in card sleeves for our board game collection. I’m honestly not sure where to start. These games get a lot of use by kids, so I need the sleeves to last. But I also have a limited budget, so I can’t spend a lot.

Also, while I was researching, I noticed that there is a lot of variety between the thickness of the sleeves, ranging from 40 microns to 110 microns. Is there a noticeable difference or does it not matter in the long run.  Should I lean towards thicker sleeves?

Any suggestions or help is greatly appreciated!

Edit:
I did not expect to get this many replies!!!

Thank you all so much! I’ve only read a few so far, but you all have been a big help! Thanks you!

Edit 2: 

Thanks again everyone! I went through every bodies suggestion and I think I might be going with either Paladin or Mayday. Both have sleeves that are at least 90 microns. Both have a variety of sizes. Both have an online store that is easy to use. And both are very nice to my budget. I might also invest in some Dragon Shields for our more expensive games. 

Here’s my notes on them if anyone’s curious: 

I’m seeing Dragonshield being suggested a lot, but I just don’t think our set budget will allow those, especially not to be used for all of our games.... maybe the more expensive ones, but definitely not all of them.

Im leaning towards Mayday but I’m hearing mixed reviews? Are the premiums bad or good? They’re definitely better for my budget, but I don’t want to cut corners and pay for it down the line. They also have a good variety of sizes

Titanshield is on the higher side of my budget but people said that their in and out of stock? Also, it doesn’t look like it has that many variety of sizes? Only available on Amazon? Currently unavailable. 100microns!

Ultra pro- everything I can find online to buy is either out of stock or the prices at so inflated. So I don’t even know what to do with that.

Paladin - I can get behind that price and their gimmick. Good variety of sizes and an online store.

Arcane Tinmen- no online store?????? Can find on Amazon but I really had to search. On the more expensive side of things. 80 microns? It’s not that much less than what everyone suggesting but.... still.... I feel like I should only look at 90 microns and up. I’m worried about price inflation on the Amazon store, and I can’t find an online store with them for future buys.

Sleeve kings - love the price. Ton of sizes. Online store!!! but only 60 microns thick. Will have premium in future but don’t know when.",boardgames,Which card sleeves are the best?
"Hello all,

I am not sure why but all of a sudden I am really into board game more than usual. I even started my own collection and tried to introduce my partner to some 2 player games. Once this virus ends I hopefully some other people will play too. Before I would pretty much 100% play only coop games but lately I have really gotten into some ""competitive"" ones.

Here is the main issue...

Coop games if someone has a lot more experience than others it really isn't a huge issue. Since you win/lose together and the experienced player can try their hardest.

Competitive games though if I have played a game 10+ times and introduce it to them they will probably lose unless I don't try hard and can turn off players much quicker.

The competitive game my partner says he enjoys is Carcassonne surprisingly but everything else they state is just okay. They generally don't like to lose. Since I have so much more experience with board games it is just a lot harder to play a non coop game.

For the past 5 years pretty much 90% of the games I played were coop board games but ever since I found out about boardgamearena and played a few games on tabletop simulator a lot of games have sparked my interest that I never what have thought I would have enjoyed.

I actually used to think I hated worker placements but after playing Keyflower and Tzolkin it really open my eyes to how fun some of those games can be. My previous experience was pretty much Lords of Waterdeep and Champions of Midgard.

"I'm a veteran of deckbuilding games and I quite enjoy the mechanic, but with Aeon's End, I can't help but wonder if I'm missing something.  We won our first game, but every game since has been ""build up for a few turns (which take way too long) then die suddenly when the boss suddenly explodes on us.""  The game doesn't seem to go long enough to buildup the power necessary to defeat the boss, but it doesn't play fast enough to learn by trial and error.  As it stands, it seems like winning and losing has a lot more to do with randomness than it does with strategy.  The core gameplay seems decent enough, but the bosses seem consistently broken.  I generally play with three players.  Am I missing something?

Edit: We're playing on TTS--scripted version.  We've tried the four base bosses, but not much else.  We're more or less playing the core game with some added characters, I believe.

Edit 2: Thanks for all the great feedback.  It seems like this game just isn't a good fit for me or my group.  I just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something.  Perhaps if I owned it and could burn through some two player games, I could figure it out, but playing with three online, it just takes too long and is too frustrating in the end.  And there are other games I'd much rather own.

"Because I’ve enjoyed Bloodborne the board game so much and Darkest Dungeon the board game adaptation is another game that is currently under my radar, I’m wondering if I should pre order it.

I know the two games are completely different and done by different companies - I am in no way saying that because I enjoyed Bloodborne, I’ll enjoy Darkest Dungeon.

Before I got Bloodborne, I saw comments like how the game can be confusing and that there are issues with the timer etc., and I am glad I got it anyway. I would totally have missed one of my favourite games otherwise. To me, for example, the timer mechanic seems sensible, as it makes the game more puzzly and board gamey.

Darkest Dungeon so far gets criticisms for being too fiddly and overly convoluted. I’ve never played the video game, and if I had to choose between a video game and a board game, I’d choose a board game version because I generally feel more immersed in a game with a tactile aspect involved.

* Modular pieces were not individual hexes, it was groups of hexes
* Modular board pieces were neoprene/rubber
* It had a medieval-fantasy type setting
* In their walkthrough videos they described it as being somewhat like a moba in gameplay
* Each player had a castle with defensive structures that could be upgraded
* It was a crowdfund game, can't remember if Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc.
* Fairly positive they had multiple expansions planned
* Was maybe posted like 3-5 years ago, but not 100% sure

[Tac Tac Jack/Toc Toc Woodman/Click Clack Lumberjack](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39206/tac-tac-jack) is a design by Justin Oh, originally published in 2008 and published in the US by Mayday games in 2011. [Justin pointed out on Twitter](https://twitter.com/oh_gemblo/status/1364590538431717376) the similarities between his game and the new campaign [Bamboo Bash](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sleevekings/bamboo-bash-2-8-player-panda-dexterity-game) by Imperial Games. From what I can see, Imperial is just another shell company for Mayday/Sleeve Kings, they're all owned by the same guy. The campaign makes slight mention of TTJ as the ""spiritual successor"" to Bamboo Bash, but the core game is essentially identical. They're so similar that they even pulled a quote from the original SU&amp;SD review of the game to use in this new campaign. 

Some discussion on Twitter noted that they're likely [planning the same thing with other games](https://twitter.com/dustinbschwartz/status/1364634193238646784), reprinting games that have had the license revoked with minimal changes. In that case, it appears that the game in question has already been licensed to /u/el_poopo's company.

Here is my collection so far. It doesn't seem like much, but most of these games contain most of their expansions. I've been collecting since 2019, but I received my first game, **Agricola** 8 years ago. I got the base set of **Dominion** soon after that. The second picture is my Dominion collection including everything but Seaside and Hinterlands. I like to keep my collection tight and if I feel like there's any overlap in mechanics, I'll consider removing it.

A couple of my favorites:

* **Root:** A great game to collect. The aesthetic grabbed me and look forward to playing with a dedicated group.
* **El Grande:** I love teaching this game. It feels like I'm revealing a magic trick when I explain the Castillo mechanic.
* **Pax Pamir** \- Beautiful game. Only played with 2. Look forward to playing with a higher player count.
* **Obsession** \- Just played my first game yesterday and really enjoyed it. The rhythm of the game is very good.
* **ICECOOL** \- A game I wish I had as a kid. Haven't tried the race variation with the sequel yet, but looking forward to it.

There are a couple weird gems here. I like looking for odd games with interesting blends of mechanics. Let me know if there are any others I should look into!

* **Darkover**: Designed by the creators of Cosmic Encounter. This game cracks me up every time. It's totally silly, but I enjoy the artwork and the rock paper scissors mechanic.
* **Desktop Hebocon Battle Kit:** Heard about this game through Rolling with Ruel. Very fun game.

Games that might be leaving soon (Some not pictured):

* **Hanabi (not pictured)**: I only need one coop card game. Coops don't land well with friends and family. However, I look forward to trying out ***The Crew*** when I can get four friends to the table again.
* **Galaxy Trucker:** Borrowed from a family member. Played it once or twice. ***Starship Catan*** does a better job at that space hitchhiking vibe IMO.
* **Startups:** Tried it with three people.. did not totally get the point of the game. There are plenty of matching card games with a regular deck I would rather play. Maybe I'm missing something, will try playing with a higher player count before removing.
* **Agricola:** Agricola is a stressful experience keeping everyone well-fed. I'm enjoying ***Keyper*** much more than Agricola and I've lumped them in the same category, so I may get rid of it.

Games that need more time:

* **Lisboa**: I have setup this game too many times just to figure out the rules. I've tried playing it 3 times with different friends and I've never successfully finished a game. It might be too crunchy for me. I got the KS edition in a used pile at a game store for $80 and I'm not ready to give up on it. One day I will have a successful play.
* **Fort:** Felt way to finicky the first couple times playing. The order of events felt wonky to me, but I may need a couple more play throughs before I pass it on.
* **Hall of the Mountain King**: I wanted to find a cool polyomino game to add to my collection. This one is pretty fun, but I'm realizing most polyomino games feel very solitair-y (little player interaction) and I'm not a fan of that kind of game (i.e. **Wingspan, Agricola, GWT**)**.** Need a couple more play throughs to determine.

"I recently discovered the ttsclub discord and found it fantastic for playing real-time online: [https://discord.me/ttsclub](https://discord.me/ttsclub)

The looking-for-games channel is pretty much a bulletin board where people post 'looking for group' ads (lfg) all day long. Right now the discord has 3.8k members and seems to be pretty active most days, varying by time of day. With it I've been able to try so many games I've been interested in, and way more than before the pandemic. A handful of games have been added to my purchase list for sure.

People follow community behavior standards and I've had a great experience so far. I find this even better than BGA because of the voice aspect combined with the freeform 'around a table' feel of tts. Most hosts are willing to teach the game too. I think the discord would benefit from a growing userbase.

What you need:

* [discord](https://discord.com/) app and free login
* microphone
* [tabletop simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/286160/Tabletop_Simulator/) app ($20 regular price)

Familiarity with the UI on tts takes a bit of getting used to, and the program has a very brief tutorial that is helpful.

How it works:

Someone interested in hosting a game will give a bot command in the channel to create a notification with voting buttons that you use to indicate you're interested. When the lfg gets enough players, the host opens a voice chat channel in the discord and creates a tts server with a password to start the game.

If you want to host a game yourself, you can use these commands in the looking-for-games channel to look for people to join:

1. !lfg &lt;message&gt; - start a lfg. When you are starting the game (or canceling), click the red X to delete the lfg so people won't continue to join.
2. !cv &lt;room name&gt; - open a voice chat room, then join that room by clicking it in the left sidebar under 'rooms'.",boardgames,TTSCLUB is awesome for finding tabletop simulator games/groups!

"[Kickstarter in Question](http://Ares Expedition - The Terraforming Mars Card Game, via @Kickstarter https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/strongholdgames/ares-expedition-the-terraforming-mars-card-game?ref=android_project_share)

So I've yet to actually make the jump into owning the physical TM boardgame. I typically love this style of gameplay, but was scared away by all the criticism of the component quality and questionable nature of the company that makes it. In the last few weeks I decided to pick up the digital version of the game on my phone to see if it would be worth pursuing the physical game. Decided I enjoyed it enough that I'd look for a second hand copy to mitigate any disappointment I might experience if the components did turn out to be that bad.  Figured worse case, I'd keep the cards and look for ways to upgrade the rest of it myself. Today while looking for something else on Kickstarter, I came across the Ares Project campaign and got curious. As a collector,  I'm something of a completionist, so the temptation to go after the Corporate Investor level (all in first nee game plus big box version with all expansions) plus the metal resource cubes and 4 neoprene mats from the addons is pretty high. The campaign claims that if you order the add-ons now its cheaper then if you do it after the campaign ends, but those suckers are already disgustingly expensive. I'm a fairly seasoned Kickstarter backer, and no stranger to pricey big ticket campaigns, KDM comes to mind, but this feels overpriced to me. Couple that with a general sense of anger and disgust from folks in the comment section has me seriously questioning backing at all. 

So my question for you guys is this, what is your opinion? Do you think the game is worth it to go all in at 370$ for all I mentioned above plus shipping to the US? Are the components really that terrible? Is the company that horrible? What would you do, or what do you plan to do?",boardgames,Unsure about the new Terraforming Mars Kickstarter

"When I first started playing like 7 or 8 years ago, the majority of publishers were small independent companies. Even FFG as big as it was, was very ""mom and pop"", ""part of the community"", type of ""small business"".

I feel like if the murderer chooses 2 completely unrelated items, it is really difficult for the investigators to win.

For example, we had a round with candlesticks + lens. It was just impossible. There was no reasonable cause of death that could be chosen (candlesticks can be used for burning, but there didnt seemt to be anything that could point towards that. It could have been used for a blunt weapon but people would consider other stuff like punch/ bat first). As if getting candlesticks out was not hard enough, there was nowhere near enough clues to flesh out lens. The clues we were getting were ""relationship"", ""duration"" , ""victims build"", ""weather"" , ""motive"" and ""evidence"". It just felt like without the burnt keyword, it was impossible to flesh out the candlesticks clue without leaving enough clues to point everyone towards the lens.

"I've always loved board games but I really got into the hobby after my divorce. Some friends got me back into *Magic The Gathering* and I started going to one of our LGS where I made some new friends that loved gaming as much as I do. After a while, we would hang out at my house and we decided to start playing board games together. I was addicted and would grab a new board game (or three) every month for us to play. I would do a lot of research on BGG and watch videos from Shut Up Sit Down, Dice Tower and Wil Wheaton's TableTop. I started hosting weekly game nights and we also did some campaign sessions of *Shadows Over Brimstone, Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, Gloomhaven* and *Arkham Horror TCG*. 

[The first bookshelf I got to start housing my collection. ](https://preview.redd.it/gvh1jp177cj61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ff00c8c98080613829ac29e826316a9ab8fd500)

I love my collection and want to keep adding more games. The biggest things I would change would be my shelving and organization. I really would like to get a nicer looking and better-organized solution for my collection. If anyone has any recommendations, I would love to hear them. 

[I added these two short book shelves after my collection grew too big for the first one.](https://preview.redd.it/cw2cfa587cj61.jpg?width=1960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a428ecd21eb30489b312a8abb28f52c2d9a18d8)

Some of my favorite games in my collection are *Twilight Imperium, Power Grid, Bohnanza, Galaxy Trucker, Terraforming Mars* and *Mage Knight*. I enjoy a broad range of genres but I absolutely love heavy strategy games the most. I am always interested in new recommendations for my ever-growing collection. Thanks!",boardgames,[COMC] Been obsessed with the hobby for seven years now. Love my collection but definitely looking for recommendations for a better shelving/organization system and new games.

"I first got into the hobby in 2014 after being told by my piano teacher about this new game store opening up in the local mall that rents out board games. Back then the only board games I played were in the vein of Monopoly, Scrabble, Chess, Checkers, and the like. Little did I know of the path my instructor had just set me on.

[My collection after 7 years](https://imgur.com/a/MzqeBDL)

**Not pictured:**
*Arkham Horror LCG* (it's in the Under the Pyramids Box),
*Too Many Bones,
Twilight Imperium 4th Edition,
Rising Sun w/ Daimyo Box,
Mage Knight Ultimate Edition,
Suburbia Collector's Edition,
Dwellings of Eldervale,
Gloomhaven*

**My first 5 games:**

1. *Arkham Horror 2nd Edition.* I gifted this to my cousin last year, but this was the first board game I ever got after checking out the first lgs in city for the first time. The only knowledge I had of Cthulhu &amp; friends at the time was from the video game *Scribblenauts*. When I saw a board game about it my initial reaction was ""Wait what? What is this thing?"". I scoped out a few reviews of the game as soon as I got home and ended up getting it as a birthday present. Would I recommend this to some one looking to get their first board game? Hell no. But without seeing it I have my doubts I'd have got into the hobby at all.

2. *Betrayal at the House on the Hill.* The first time I ever saw this was on TableTop and was blown away with the idea of creating a haunted mansion. I still have this in my collection, but it only gets to the table for Halloween these days.

3. *Smash Up.* A few months after I got Arkham Horror my friends got me into *Magic: The Gathering* (but that's a whole other story). I loved the deckbuilding, resource management, and ease of setup, but all of our decks were exceptionally off-balance from one another. Smash Up appealed to me because it had the feeling of ""this is my unique deck"" without having to worry too much about balance.

4. *Chaos in the Old World.* Damn, I wish I bought the expansion when it was still available, I remember seeing half a dozen copies of it on the shelves of the store in the university town that I lived in at the time. Of the games I bought from my first foray into tabletop gaming this one is the most likely to see play.

5. *Archipelago.* This game sure has a lot going on. Area control, action selection, tableau management, tile laying, supply &amp; demand market boards. I had to read the rulebook several times over before I broke it out for my friends. First play took all night and we had several people come into the common area we were playing in (I lived on campus then) and asked ""what is this monstrosity"". Good times.

**My 5 newest games:**

1. *Rococo: Deluxe Edition.* This was a huge pain to find a store in Canada that had it. The search was worth it though, played it twice within the first week of it arriving. Lost the first game by a single point, won the second by 8. I love this game so far, though that may be because it is similar to *Concordia* which is another favorite of mine.

2. *Kanban EV.* I haven't had the chance to play this one yet. I really enjoy Lacerda's designs, and Ian O'Toole's art, so I'm quite looking forward to playing this one. 

3. *Canvas.* Wonderful to look at, plays really easily and quickly, and it has enough decisions to make each game to keep it interesting. I don't have a ton of games in my collection that I can just throw at a person new to tabletop gaming so this is a great addition for me.

4. *Excavation Earth.* Looking to get this one to the table. The theme is silly, but I heard there's some considerable thinky-ness to it.

5. *Blood Rage.* Got this as a Christmas gift, but my family isn't interested in war games or anything resembling one. Darn you, covid, I want my playgroup back.

**My 5 favourite games:**

1. *Spirit Island.* I own all the expansions and promo packs for this game and I can't get enough of it. I haven't played all the spirits yet with Jagged Earth now being out, but each of the ones I have played all feel so thematically tied to their mechanisms and powers. Certainly not the most digestible game rules-wise, especially for a co-op, but it's worth the learning curve.

2. *Concordia Venus.* Trading in the Mediterranean, how much drier could it be than that? Or so I thought. Every time I play this everyone feels like they have a good shot at a win, and the final scoring can be nail-biting with people taking the lead unexpectedly. The synergistic, or perhaps parasitic depending on your point of view, feels great. Planning out my moves ahead and taking opportunities as they arose both felt manageable on my first play and it only got better with more plays.

3. *Viticulture: Essential Edition.* Specifically with the *Visitors from the Rhine Valley* and the *Tuscany: Essential Edition* board. My first play of this left me lukewarm to it. So glad that I gave it another go as it's not my number 1 worker placement game. It scales really well, has a theme that helps you remember how to play, and is all in a pretty small box to boot.

4. *Scythe.* I love the theme of this game, and I kick myself for getting it so late. The ramp-up from moving your pieces from your player board to the central map is awesome, the variable powers are awesome, the components are awesome, the expansions are awesome, I think you get the idea.

5. *Too Many Bones.* Probably the most expensive game I own, Trove Chest and all. Scratches the ""kick down the door and fight monsters"" itch that *Gloomhaven* couldn't get done for me. Probably because *Gloomhaven* requires you to spend 30 minutes building the door.

**My Arbitrary Award Categories**

**Most played Game** *Wingspan.* And it's by a lot.

**Favourite Tile-Laying Game** *Castles of the Mad King Ludwig.* I like making my castle. Sometimes I forget I'm competing for points.

**Favourite Game to Play With Newcomers** *Tiny Towns.* The rules are easy, the game on the other hand...

**Game that Punches Above its Weight** *Modern Art.* Also the closest thing to a social deduction game that I'll enjoy.

**Most Convenient Box Size** *Any of Eagle-Gryphon Game's big boxes.* I like how they look in my Kallax.

**Most Inconvenient Box Size** *Mage Knight: Ultimate Edition.* The box could be half the size.

**Best Insert** *Between Two Castles.* Practically ready to play the moment you open the box.

**What I would change about my Collection**

My tastes have changed substantially since I got into the hobby. Were I to do it all again I'd hold off on buying games just because they filled a gap in my library whether it was mechanical, thematic, weight, or just the empty space on my shelf. I plan on selling off or gifting a healthy part of what I have to friends. I'm planning moving some time next year and I don't know how much space I'll end up having, so trimming off the fat is a priority for me for the next little while. 

I didn't buy many games in 2020 since I had far fewer people to play with and it gave me time to reflect on my buying habits. No more buying a game because I think it'll get a friend into the hobby. I'll make do with what I have for welcoming games. I've also been very conscientious of what Kickstarters I've been backing. I'll only back after I've read the full rulebook, assessed if there's another game on the market or in my collection that offers the same experience, and checked looked up other games by the same designer(s). If the game will end up retail, I don't usually bother unless there's very significant component upgrades and an insert/tray made for ease of setup and play.

**Shelf of Shame**

*Gaia Project.* Every time I sit down to read the rulebook I just can't focus on it. I hope to get this game learned eventually.

*Le Havre.* I love Caverna and A Feast for Odin. This is another game that I can't seem to focus enough to read the whole rulebook.

*Paladins of the West Kingdom.* I got this right before Covid restrictions hit, never got the chance to play it.

*The Crew.* A birthday gift I haven't got around to playing yet, it has been hard to get 3 other people to play a game these days.",boardgames,"[COMC] 7 Years In, Slowed Down in 2020"

"Here is my collection after a little over 3 years in this hobby. [COMC](https://imgur.com/A1II9BL)

I don't really know how I got into this. I think it was a combination of a few coworkers getting into it. We hit the ground running and played what felt like a new game a week for a while.

[Board Game Stats](https://imgur.com/XSaGh7S)

Since Covid started it's mostly just been the wife and I playing games together. We did have a weekly board game group that had gone on for over a year that we tried to migrate to Table Top Simulator but it just isn't the same.

&amp;#x200B;

**My First 5 Games I Own**

**1. Lost Legacy: The Starship**

This is a lot like Love Letter but the wife and I seem to enjoy it a lot more. We have all the expansions as well. We mostly play it 2 player but we've had a good time with more.

**2. Fallout**

Our big jump into this hobby. I look back at the fun times we had with it. I would not recommend it to people but as our first game it holds a weird place in my heart. Not enough of a place to keep it however.

**3. Tokaido**

I really liked the simplicity of it and the hopscotch nature was easy to show to family members but outside of ""it looks pretty"" we never really hit a stride with this game.

**4. Hero Realms**

This was our big ""go to the bar"" card game. Easily one of our most played games. We did try Star Realms eventually but Hero Realms worked better for us in theme and gameplay.

**5. Bloodborne the Card Game**

I love this game. The hand building and semi-cooperative nature is what draws me in so hard. This has been my favorite purchase by far.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Last 5 games I bought**

**1. My City**

Thanks to SU&amp;SD we got this game and have already gotten to chapter 5 in a couple days. Lots of fun so far.

**2. Dune Imperium**

A friend showed us this game and even though our first game took 2.5 hours. It did not feel like that and we instantly bought it. We've played a few 2 player games and we've enjoyed it quite a bit so far.

**3. Fleet the Dice Game**

A nice and quick roll and write that allows you to fill so many boxes it crazy. It's also very combo heavy.

**4. The King is Dead**

Feels like a simplified version of A War of Whispers, where you are not rooting for one particular faction to win but trying to manipulate them all to benefit you in the end more than the other players.

**5. Spire's End**

A play your own adventure book in card form. Wife and I haven't beaten it yet, with lots of endings and luck on our side I hope we can soon. We've seen a fair number of the endings so far and I am really looking forward to a sequel.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Favorite 5 games**

**1. Bloodborne the Card Game**

See above.

**2. Raiders of the North Sea/Scythia**

Love this worker placement but I think Scythia might be better if only because it cuts down on the fluff that was added in the expansions of North Sea.

**3. Coimbra**

I just love the dice mechanic in this game.

**4. Tournament at Avalon**

I haven't played a whole lot of trick games but this one with it's variable powers is a nice relaxing one. We have also bent the rules slightly to make it work 2-player when the wife and I want to play.

**5. Dune Imperium**

It's just a much better Clank! I replaced my copy with this and would do it again in a heart beat. The 2-player is fun and the 4-player is fun and doesn't feel like it drags at all. One of the best worker placements I've played at least.

"Hi all. I got into the hobby of board gaming about two years ago when my wife gifted me my favorite game, 7 wonders: duel. Since then, I've tried to play games that sample many mechanisms and weights (my initial purchases were guided by 3-minute board games' videos on games to start a collection with). After 2 years, I think my favorite games are light to medium weight euro-style games that require some thinking but can be comfortably played on a weeknight. That said, I do enjoy games like Brass and Concordia a lot when we get to them.

Usually it's just my wife and I playing these board games a few times a week. We've adapted our collection to fit in several places in our small house where we play our games on the kitchen counter :-)

I posted a few weeks ago about my [first ever board game on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pegasusgamesnyc/welcome-to-sysifus-corp-a-cut-throat-corporate-board-game) and it recently reached its funding goal 😍

So as thanks to this community for their huge help in getting funded I wanted to run a giveaway contest for my game!

EDIT: I couldn't find the ""giveaway"" flair when posting, can the mods help me flair this post appropriately? Thank you!

#### **Ground rules:**
* The giveaway is to win 1 copy of my board game, [_Welcome to Sysifus Corp_](https://sysifuscorp.com) currently valued at $40 USD.
* 5 total copies will be given out.
* The game is not yet manufactured so it might be a few months until you receive your copy.
* Only people in the contiguous United States may enter. Sorry Hawaii / Alaska and the rest of the world!
* Only 1 entry per person.
* Your account must have at least 10 karma and be at least 1 month old.
* Direct replies to this post will NOT be considered as an entry! Respond to [my comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/lqlb9w/solve_a_puzzle_and_win_a_free_board_game_giveaway/gogxn1f/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) on the post!

A quick search for ""giveaway"" shows that most of the giveaways on /r/boardgames are a little boring with people just commenting and being randomly selected.

So I wanted to post a small puzzle from my game and select 5 random people who got the correct answer as the winners. Obviously if you just copy + paste someone else's answer there is no way I can tell but I'm sure the board game hobbyists of the world aren't such lowlife cheaters!

And doing it this way, you can get a taste for what my game is like to see if you'd like it. Nobody wants games they won't play, right? _\*looks at Steam library\*_

Thank you everyone! And good luck!",boardgames,Solve a puzzle and win a free board game! Giveaway for my 100% funded game!
"So I've done a few no-ship math trades in the past and always came out about even, possibly a little under but always happy and had fun.

I've always been weary of shipping math trades, because well shipping prices are awful. Spending $10-$15 to trade for a used game is usually silly when you can just buy a new one for $30 and get it shipped free.

Anyhow, I have a stockpile of games I have no intention of playing and with the conventions getting canceled due to covid I haven't been able to trade in person so I figured what the heck.

I usually assume that things will even out in the end, come in over on some trades and under on some trades and all-in-all it would work out. That was my first mistake. Of the 15 trade matches I had every single on of them ended up being a lesser value game than the one I'm shipping.

I used the automated tool to apply duplicate protection. That was my second mistake. This bundled excellent condition games with used condition games, new version with old versions. Of the duplicates I ended up with every game being either the poorest condition of the lot or the oldest version of the lot. In one case there was a deluxe edition game that didn't bundle with the duplicate protection (as it shouldn't have) and I ended up with 2 copies of the same game. In another instance I ended up with an expansion for Aeon's End (yes an $11 game) that I'll be paying more to ship my game out than it's even worth.

I think I was secretly hoping that I would end up matching with the same users for a lot of the trades and that would help on shipping, local trades this is pretty common. Spoiler, I didn't.

Nearly all of the games I'm giving out are still new in shrink or only played once or twice. I don't think I received a single game coming in that is new in shrink. Couple that with the fact that I'm going to be out over $200 in shipping fees I think you can see I'm a bit disappointed.

Look, the fact is I'm 100% responsible for not being more vigilant in my trades, wants and research of the condition/version of the games I was willing to trade for. I know everything that went wrong is on me and I'm accepting full responsibility for it. I'm not blaming anyone or anything other than myself. I just wanted to share with others who might be interested in doing a math trade to be very very weary of what you're getting yourself into.

I have a theory now, that algorithm of the math trade tool will almost always trade for the minimum worst trade you're willing to accept because it's ultimately going to be the trade that allows the most amount of trades to be successful in the chain and that's the way it's designed to work. If that theory is true then it explains why I came out under 15/15 times.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: My intention here wasn't to scare people away from the math trades, just looking to vent and hopefully help the next schmuck that enters into one from getting taken. Keep in mind I lost here, but for every loser there's at least one winner, in this instance I very likely made 15 people very happy. Which that in itself is kinda cool I reckon. 

I'm going to add a little more context to the situation or how I get into it really. Between the games I was willing to get and the games I was willing to trade for I ended up with 17,827 boxes checked. Obviously, that was pretty near impossible and very much overwhelming. So I utilized two tools to help me out 1.) duplicate protection which put 20 of the ""same"" items into a single category and 2.)  assigning a fixed value to both my items and the items I wanted and then hit apply. 

I will try math trades again, I'll just be a lot more picky and a lot more vigilant with my choices and submissions and so should you.",boardgames,My experience from doing a my first shipping math trade
"So, as a backer, I just received an email regarding the **Radlands** Kickstarter:

""This is a message from Kickstarter’s Trust and Safety team. We're writing to inform you that a project you backed, Radlands ☢️, is the subject of an intellectual property dispute.

The law requires that we remove the project from public view until the dispute is resolved (please see our Copyright Policy and Trademark Policy for more info). Because the project already ended successfully, your pledge hasn’t been affected. The creator should still be able to move forward with the project (and send any unfulfilled rewards). If you have any questions, though, you can still message the creator from the project page.""

I've messaged them but was wondering if anyone had any insight already?  The theme was fairly generic post-apocalypse from what I recall so not sure what the point of contention might be.

"Hey guys,

I tried searching a thread like this but couldn't really find it. Anyway, I'm currently developing my first board game. Last week I received the first batch of upgraded prototype cards and I'm slowly starting to research companies that can produce it when it's all done.
Now the point is that most of them produce in China, which makes it cheap. Most of the time the production process isn't that clear or clearly not sustainable. Of course there are local alternatives, but that means the cost goes up.
My question, as the title says, are you willing to pay more for a game with a sustainable production process?",boardgames,Are you willing to pay extra for sustainably produced games?
"I want to preface that I’m not saying no other game has done any of these before, because while I’ve played a fair number of worker placement games, there are many I have not, especially heavier one. I do want to give this game some love though, because I was pleasantly surprised by the game over all.  
 

1. Worker spots randomly being blocked – Each round you roll some dice and based on what comes up, some of the spaces may be blocked by a variety of foes, from mutant mole rats to raiders. And it does it with these cool clear cards so the overlay looks neat.

2. The only way to unblock them is the fight the blocker – You have to go to a space and fight whatever is there to free the space up for another round later. This is also mainly about a dice roll, but the game does provide some way to mitigate it in the form of items you can get.

3. Losing one of these fights hurts your worker – You can still use the worker, but only on spaces for wounded workers. There is one standard space on the board for this, and others may be added later. If all those special spaces are taken and you have an injured worker, you won’t get to use the worker this round. Again, there are items that can help some with this.

4. You can train workers for the round – There are spaces or items that you can use to train your workers, and if they go to a space where training in a certain area is noted, you get double the resources listed. This is one I think I’ve seen in other games, or at least games where there are preset special workers.

I’ve played the game three times now and have really enjoyed it. My only complaint is that it almost seems to end to quickly, especially when I’ve built up a few neat item or room combos. Are there other worker placement games that do similar thing? I’m especially interested in spots where problems show up and you have to deal with them, as I thought that was a very neat mechanic. 

And while the game has a fair amount of randomness, I think the shortness I mentioned before help to change how that feels. Definitely a game that was a pleasant surprise, and I picked it up after seeing it on the top ten surprised of 2020 list that the Dice Tower put out.

And fair warning, the game does come in a lunch pail tin, which I know is a problem for some.  I'm not crazy about it myself, but the insert is very nice and organized.",boardgames,Fallout Shelter – Some worker placement mechanics I’ve never seen before

"I've tried looking for a thread on this heavy eurogame, but couldn't find one. If there is one, just redirect me there :-)

I'm a fan of this game, and it seems to be fairly unknown. I don't get to play this as often as I like. It takes at least 2.5 hours to play, and offers some manipulation. If you're keeping an eye on that, you're forced to keep an eye on the other players. In other words, plenty of player interaction.  
I guess the theme isn't for everyone, but you don't need any knowledge of the subject to play the game.

I'm not sure if my copy is officially mine; it was bought by a friend for another mutual friend. But she expected it to be easy and focused on triva.

I heard that the London version is not so complex and unbalanced so it is rather an entry into the series but NY version is way better. However what about the expansion pack?

I started collecting about 3 years ago although I have been playing for while. I wanted to have a collection that could handle a variable number of players (1 to 8+) with different level so that if any group coming home, I would  have something to play with them. I also wanted to have an easy learning curve of various game mechanic to introduce new players for example :

* Card drafting : Sushi Go -&gt; Citadels -&gt; 7th wonders
* Engine Building : Splendor -&gt; Century Golem Edition -&gt; Terraforming Mars
* Worker placement : Harbour -&gt; Caverna

I would like to highlight few lesser known one (links are to boardgamegeek.com or creator's website) :

* [Tranquility](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/288513/tranquility) : Cooperative card game like ""The Mind""  but less stressful. You have a grid and need to fill it up in ascending number without communicating. (Great when Mother-in-law is visiting :&gt; )
* [The Grizzled](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/171668/grizzled) : Cooperative card game about surviving in the trenches of WWI.
* [Operation archeo (french)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/235830/operation-archeo) : Cooperative game about archeological excavation inspired by real ones.
* [Reflet d'acide (french) ](https://www.refletsdacide.com/) : It's the boardgame of an awesome french audio saga (inspired of pen&amp;paper roleplaying game). Just received it and I didn't had time to play. (it has cooperative and competitive play, but you probably guessed which version we'll play... :D)

Our favorite game is Mysterium (with tweaked rules and full cooperation). You can play with anybody of any level and people get quite engaged. The other one when we have more experienced players is Spirit Island.

If I had to change something I would remove Mage Knight as I took to it play solo but I just don't have the time for it and the other one is Argent the consoritum which is just too complex for the liking of my friends.

* Gloomhaven
* Reflet d'acide
* Tranquility
* Sherlock holmes consulting detective
* Splendor
* Sentinels of the multiverse
* Century Golem edition
* Exploding kittens
* Avalon
* Munchkin Steampunk
* Codenames

* Operation Archeo

"So obviously I don't want to associate myself with one of the most terrible men in all of history, but I pretty much had a game of War of the Ring that was only an hour long.  I was playing the fellowship side and draw a card that let me activate the North to war.  I was able to get Gandalf to Bree and activate the faction on my second die of the game.  

From here, I spent the next 4 dice mustering an army and headed towards isengard.  My opponent started to re-enforce Isengard, but I tricked him and headed west into Moria.  I sieged Moria while he brought a host from Angbad and mirkwood.  To pincer me .  I survived the pincer attack but it left me unable to siege, and so I worked on getting elves into war.  

After some muster dice, I emptied out rivendale and Lorien and I was all in on my military victory as the free peoples.  There was a stuborn loan orc in Moria, but I eventually was able to secure the mountain.  

The blitzkrieg continued while I sent my rohan into Isengard to secure my win.  I sent gandalf from Moria into Fangorn to shell the tower with Ent artillery.  I took out 2 of the people before pushing in the siege.  

At this point my opponent remarked how he has never not had his factions at war by this point, since he was reacting to me.  He never ended up touching the easterlings in the game at all.  Minas Tirith never saw a battle either.

He sends is moria orcs to help Isengard while it's under siege.  This was my Battle of Briton.  I failed to defeat Isengard.  Only one orc remained with Saruman before the host of orcs from Mordor came to destroy me.  

At this point I thought the war was lost.  But I looked toward the Shire and Mirkwood.  I brough armies into a pincer attack into angmar.  It was a race since Isengard and mirkwood were claiming the territories I left.  He had already claimed my empty Lorien from earlier.  

Eventually The Fellowship that never left, sent the reamaining 7 heroes to help assist the northern army with Elves.  I had used up every elf and Northern army piece in my reserve.  My opponent sent a lone orc from Isengard up the coast to the grey havens. It was a race, and ultimately I defeated Angmar and took the military victory.

The game ended in a little over an hour.  It was an experience neither one of us had before. Most of our cards didn't work.  I had cards that were only playable while I was the defender, and he had cards only playable while he was sieging.

"Hi Reddit, this is my first post on this subreddit so please excuse me. I've always been a fan of the Idea of creating my own board game that one day I could hopefully develop into a popular game. 

Here I have for you a concept that is extremely basic, just to warn you, and that has yet to be fleshed out however I wanted to get some opinions and ideas going in order to spur on possible development.

The concept name for this board game is ""Pseudo-Psyche"".

It's a fast paced strategy game (unsure of player amounts atm) that involves players drawing a set number of cards at the beginning of the game. The idea of the game is to lower all of your opponents sanity points to 0 by using a variety of these cards in a turn based manner in order to affect other players actions. However there's a catch, the cards drawn throughout the game remain face down and as your turn comes around, you may choose to reveal 1 card from your hand to receive it's affect or carry out it's action.

These cards will range from simply swapping cards with opponents, to peaking at opponents cards, to also affecting your opponents sanity bar.

And at the heart of the game lies each player's sanity. I am unsure as to what the set sanity points each player will have will be however, sanity points will decrease by a set scale of units per turn which can be increased or decreased by the effects of the ""thought cards"" drawn and played.

Once again, I apologize for how very basic this concept is however I thought this would be the best place to receive critique, support and possible interest in my concept. Feel free to leave any type of comments on your thoughts or message me if this is potentially something you would consider yourself wanting to play or be a part of.

Many thanks Reddit.",boardgames,"New concept for a fun and fast paced strategic board game by the name of ""Pseudo-Psyche"""
"Dear redditors, I am creating a space-themed 4x board game.

The main appeal should be extreme strategic depth with very simple rules and very little luck involved.

I have just finished tweaking for the last time the game manual (11 pages, less than Risk!), and the play testing I've run so far with a couple of friends was met with great success: this is among the most brain-racking games I've played, but the rules are indeed extremely simple and it allows for infinite replayability, considering that every single game is different and allows to experiment with different strategies.

But! I don't know if it would appeal the greater public beyond me and my buddies, so...

What would you like to see in a game like this?

Does the concept sound appealing?

Also, given that this is my first time considering the production of a board game, do you have any advice for a newbie like me?

"It was fun! 

Some more specific observations:

\- We played the recommended ""we need more samples"" scenario for new players with five players.

\- With five players, six rounds, I figured okay, that should be an hour or an hour or a half.  It took us about three.

\- Some people just couldn't figure out what to do on their turn.  There are a lot of choices!  And none of the players except me had ever heard of the game or knew any rules before playing. There's definitely a hill to climb while learning.  

\- We got lucky with the characters.  We had two characters who could kill four zombies (total) a turn with no risk at the colony, and another that added two food every turn at the colony.

\- That being said, it seemed suspiciously easy.

\- Turned out, only two players were really trying to satisfy their own win conditions.  One of the other three was the betrayer and afterward said, ""It felt bad to betray everyone and I figured it would be impossible, so I decided to just help instead.""  I gave her high marks for being a good person, and bad marks for being a bad player.

\- Everyone agreed they liked it and would play again.

\- Some tips: have the standees for the characters set up and near the board.  It was time consuming looking for them even when they were set up and nearby - would have been worse if they were in a pile somewhere.  

\- Make sure people understand what the symbols mean for the various types of cards.   This was a surprisingly big stumbling block for our group.  

\- More than one person should add zombies at the end of turns.  That takes a little while and the time adds up.

\- The 1/12 chance for instant death is a great mechanic that resulted in cheers, groans and other reactions every time.  We had two 'bites' in a crowd, both times we got lucky, rolled the dice, 

\- It's hard to remember the crossroad cards, but we had a couple trigger and each one was fun. We got lucky there again (had a character present that basically canceled the dilemma).

"Hi there! I love board games, and have quite a few games ranging from patchwork to Wavelength to Endeavor to Twilight Imperium.

I don't particularly enjoy them because I find them very luck dependant and don't require much thinking. I'd like to find games similar to these in the fact that they are:

* Take-That
* Easy to learn
* Plays 6 or so players
* Doesn't typically take over an hour to play (UU sometimes does, and its awful)

"Within the last year or two, I have been getting more and more into board games. Scythe and Wingspan have become to of my new favorite games as I've ventured into this new hobby. I have all of respect for Stonemaier (SM) Games for creating incredibly different, but insanely fun games to play with friends. I am definitely interested in trying out Viticulture!

Last Wednesday, I ordered 3 Scythe expansions, 1 Wingspan expansion, and the expansion to the main Scythe board. It was a pretty big order, and with shipping cost around $160. This was the first time I have ordered from their website. As you know if you've ordered from the site, they send a confirmation email of the order, and state that later you should receive an email when your order is shipped.

Yesterday, I learned about the SM Champion Membership, which would allow for 25% discounts on all online store orders and shipping costs. All you have to pay is $15 for a year. Sounds great! But I had already payed for my big order.

I wanted to try my luck in seeing if I could get the order I had just placed discounted by the purchase of a membership. At this point, I had not received a shipping confirmation email, so I figured if this wasn't possible, I could at least cancel the order. I reached out to their representative to see what we could do. My thought was that the membership could be bought with the amount of the discount I would receive from that order OR I could just buy the membership separately, and they apply the discount to the order afterwards. I would be totally fine with either method.

Nope. They would not. They claim that retroactive discounts are not possible, even within the short amount of time since the placement of the order. I asked if I could cancel the order to restart the process of doing ""the right order of purchases"" to get the discount. Nope. My order has apparently shipped. Where was my shipping email? It just happened to show up as soon as this communication was finished... But don't worry, I was reminded that ""there will be many opportunities for you to use your Champion benefits in the future"".

To be honest, this kinda put a bad taste in my mouth about SM Games. People (including myself) respect the developers and designers so much, but having non-user friendly business practices is definitely a small blemish that I'm sure SM Games does not want. I thought I would support SM Games directly, but now I have this burning question: Why not just shop through Amazon, where most of the SM products are cheaper (even compared to a 25% discount)? 

 I made a mistake, so I thought I'd share it with you all so you do not make the same mistake. I am definitely still looking forward to playing with all my expansions.

"Like many others, I enjoyed Board Games in my youth; all the classics, monopoly especially.  I played MTG and Warhammer growing up and eventually fell out of the CCG crowd. In high school my friends and I started playing boxed games on our lunch hour, favourites of which were Munchkin and Star Wars Epic Duels. After Graduating and through university and beyond, I was much more into video games than board games, never having more than a couple in my closet, including new classics like Catan and Carcasonne. It wasn't until I went back to college in my late 20's that the Hobby was started.

I moved into a cheap apartment with a couple friends from school, and while we played a lot of video games, I also started becoming interested in Board Games again, thanks to Tabletop with Will Wheaton. There was a whole new change in the kind of games that were available, so took a leaping jump in with titled like Legendary, Ticket to Ride, and Blood Rage. 

Following that, I moved around a bit and finally settled into the place I am now, and where I have been for the past 3 years. Since moving here, the collection has exploded.

"COMC After One Year in the Hobby https://imgur.com/gallery/8oqiTbc

Hey all. I started getting into board gaming as a hobby about a year ago (when COVID started). I am having a lot of fun, although not being able to play with friends in person for the most part has been a bummer. Although I have used Tabletop Simulator to play some things virtually with friends. With that I thought I'd share the first 5 games I bought, the last 5 games I bought, my 5 favorite games, my games that I have yet to play, and my crowd funding backlog. Feel free to discuss or ask questions.

**My First 5 Games**
1. **Catan** - The gateway for many. This is the game that made me think about getting a second game since my wife and I were going to need something to do while quarantining. I still appreciate Catan, but I am kind of over it, especially at high player counts.

2. **Ticket to Ride** - This is the game that truly got me hooked. I thought if a board game that I barely knew about can be this good, what else am I missing? After buying this I really went down the research rabbit hole.

3. **Disney Villainous** - My wife and I got a lot of fun out of this, got all the expansions. This is another game I'm kind of over now though. It drags at large player counts and the balancing is all over the place. It's also a heavier game than the theme would suggest.

4. **Tiny Towns** - A really good puzzly game. Doesn't get as much play anymore, but I still like it.

5. **Century: Golem Edition** - This is a great entry level game. Very easy to teach. Everyone I've shown it to enjoys it.

**The Last 5 Games I Bought**
1. **Dice Throne** - Only got 2 battle boxes so far and am waiting on the rest of them to be delivered. Haven't tried it yet but looking forward to it.

2. **Eclipse: Second Dawn for the Galaxy** - Waiting for it to be safe to have a larger group over to bust this out. Can't wait.

3. **Dwellings of Eldervale** - Tried this with my wife and then solo. So far I really love it. Can't wait to try with larger player counts.

4. **Blood Rage** - Another one that I'm waiting for more people to play it as I have heard it's not great at two.

5. **Fallout Shelter the Board Game** - Really light entry level worker placement game. I enjoy it but not as much as other worker placement games in my collection.

**My 5 Favorite Games so Far**
1. **Scythe** - I really like the mixture of mechanisms in this game and how many different paths to victory you can take.

2. **7 Wonder Duel** - Just a really good two player drafting game. My wife and I have a lot of fun with this one.

3. **Dwellings of Eldervale** - Turns out I just really like hybrid games. I love this for the same reasons I love Scythe, I just need to play it more.

4. **Everdell** - Great theme and a lot of fun at all player counts. I like how this game really ramps up as you go. At the beginning it's hard to believe you will get fifteen cards but if you build your engine right you can have plenty of options by the end.

5. **Moonrakers** - A really fun game with more people. It forces you to work with each other and negotiate while everyone is still out for themselves.

"I've been gaming for about ten years now, since my husband and some friends got me into it. This is my shared collection with my husband. We've expanded it quite a bit in the last year. Storage is a huge issue for us as I'm sure you'll see. The collection right now is stored in four different spots. We have plans to get or build larger board game storage in our dining room so that we can keep everything in one place sometime soon. Right now the dream is to build built-in cabinetry in the dining room just for board games. Not sure yet if that will happen but it would be pretty cool!

Here's the collection, in four parts. With some details about each section.

**The Main Shelf: Favourites and games that play well with 2p**

[Cabinet in the dining room that currently holds 46 of our most cherished games.](https://preview.redd.it/o8h8a8stf1j61.jpg?width=3492&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66d525a339da7c88003323083005c0e784f48495)

This is our go-to board game shelf. Usually board games around here are played by just my husband and I, especially recently when we can't safely have friends and family over to play games! So you'll see a strong leaning towards games that play well with two players. You may also notice a pattern - I love tile laying games! Recently as new games come in we've had to 'demote' some games from this shelf which is getting harder and harder to do!

Some longterm favourites that we have played hundreds (in some cases thousands!) of times over the years are **Patchwork**, **Ticket to Ride** (the game that got me into the hobby!), **Jaipur**, **Citadels** and **Lost Cities.** More recently **Gods Love Dinosaurs**, **Azul** &amp; **Hanamikoji** have been all the rage at our house.

As far as unplayed games on this shelf, we haven't gotten around to **Viticulture** yet. We have a handful of games here that we've gotten within the past month and haven't had a chance to play yet: **Mysterium Park**, **Castles of Mad King Ludwig** and **Architects of the West Kingdom**. There are also a couple of games here that my husband has played and I haven't yet: **Terra Mystica**, **Pandemic** and **Race for the Galaxy.**

There aren't many games in here that either of us don't like. I'm not big on **Santorini**, but we haven't played with the God powers yet which I think will greatly improve the experience. We're waiting for **Century: Eastern Wonders** to arrive which will easily take the place of **Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small**, which neither of us likes much.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Tiny Games Drawer**

[Also in our dining room, this drawer houses smaller games that we had to bump out of the larger cabinet to make room for new additions.](https://preview.redd.it/2efrpr5oi1j61.jpg?width=4656&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d40f2e25af2c829ebcea0c57878967487a5deb33)

There are some gems in this drawer. **Village Green**, **Letterpress**, and **Air, Land &amp; Sea** are all new and exciting. **Sushi Go!** is one of our most played games ever but unlike some games I can play with no limit, I've grown a bit tired of it now. **Coup** is a great game to make me temporarily hate my husband (he's too good at lying!). And while we haven't played **Gloom** or **Oz Fluxx** in a long time, they were the first games I bought for myself. There are four unplayed games in this drawer, all of which I'm hoping to get to the table soon: **Paperback**, **Once Upon a Time**, **Harry Potter Trading Card Game** &amp; **Valley of the Kings: Afterlife**.

**Basement shelving part 1: Party Games and Word Games**

[These shelves house our party games, most of our word games, some of my husband's beloved childhood games and some garage sale rescues. Some odds and ends too.](https://preview.redd.it/gmrp6dibk1j61.jpg?width=3492&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2014e77eb3193569758239fc46d4eb4334115f54)

Among these ones **Scattergories** is a clear favourite. Several of these games are ones my husband has been playing since he was young. And there are even two games here that were mine as a kid: **Rush Hour** and **Polemic**. **Scotland Yard** and **A Game of Thrones** are two of my husband's favourite games that were moved down here a few weeks ago to make space on our main shelf for games we play together.

**Basement Shelving Part 2: Everything Else**

&amp;#x200B;

[Mostly games that don't get much play from us.](https://preview.redd.it/1l5jsjc8l1j61.jpg?width=3492&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9956097d516f7d48e19d72660e1a0141c7b923e9)

With the exception of three games, these are all games that we both don't particularly like or haven't played yet. The exceptions are **Marrying Mr. Darcy** (which I like a lot but isn't the kind of game that you can play often), **Power Grid** (my husband likes this ones but doesn't think it would be good with two players) and **Castle Panic** (which I really enjoy but my husband doesn't).

Well - that's the collection! The only thing I've left out is my husband's Magic the Gathering collection. 

I'm really glad I could share it with you all. This hobby has brought me a lot of joy and comfort.

If I could change anything about my collection it would be to not have any unplayed games and to continue adding games that are slightly more complex. We have some games preordered that I think will present a nice challenge for me. I struggle with long periods of depression during which it's hard to find the motivation or focus enough to play games above a low complexity. I also have severe anxiety disorders that wipe me out and limit what I can play a lot of the time. Usually when I'm depressed or highly anxious I rely on replaying games I know well over and over. The past year has been fun because I haven't been depressed and I've been able to play a lot of new games. From games that had been sitting around unplayed to new additions to our shelves, I've been enjoying having more options to draw from and the brain space to play them. I played 34 games for the first time in 2020. A blast.

With that in mind, I'll leave off with one last picture that makes me very happy to have had this extended break from the hell that is depression. I don't know how long it will last but oh boy have I ever made the best of it.

Please leave me your thoughts and questions in the comments. Nothing beats chatting about board games - except playing them!

"I'm working on a top 5 gayest games list and I'm a bit stuck so I was looking for inspiration here. Since LGBTQ representation is rather low in the boardgames industry, anything in a broader sense of the term also applies.

For me some of the games I see as LGBTQ are Rococo and Love Letter. Both have a very campy vibe, and a very pastel color scheme. Rococo especially, when we play it we refer to all garments as ""dresses"" and sometimes get into character as Haute Couture designers...

So, what do you see as the gayest/most LGBTQ game you have?

"Had the pleasure of finally playing TM recently and loved it. 

Just wanted to clarify three things if anyone is in the know:

1. Do cities ALWAYS give a 1M€ production increase when placed or is that only when using the specific action printed on the board?
2. Do cards that require tags to play include their own tags in that total?
3. Are blue cards with more than one action allowed to use each action once per generation or only once in total per generation?

"**The story**  
On an island inhabited by indigenous peoples, the white man comes, bringing with him the exploitation and destruction of the territory. The players are the nature spirits who try to help the natives rid the island of invaders before it’s too late. 

**The gameplay**  
The first game was traumatic and we lost badly, thanks to the fact that the rules, although clearly explained, are not at all intuitive.  
The second game went much better. It took a game “thrown” to understand the mechanics and how to exploit them. It is not an easy game, it takes a lot of strategy to survive and it is not suitable for those who want a light game. We had to think and think a lot, trying to do the best with what we know and with what we have available. The feeling of paying a lot for a “wrong” turn is definitely noticeable. 

**The design**  
There are very interesting design elements, first of all the fact that the players know the behavior of the enemies in advance (of 2 out of 3 actions that they make). Also interesting is the fact that it’s a cooperative game where players start out very weak and have to hold out long enough to power up and start the counterattack. The first 2/3 turns are crucial in determining how easy (or difficult) it will be to win. 

**Final thoughts**  
Spirit Island is a very good game, with a lot of replayability and a unique feeling to it. It’s not a game for inexperienced gamers and, on the other hand, can lead easily to the feared analysis paralysis in more thinky gamers, BUT if it lands in your sweet spot, it’s a game you don’t want to miss.",boardgames,Spirit Island - my point of view

"Hey there,

first time Reddit user. I still have to get used to it, I've tried a few introductions according to the rules, but everytime there was a little snag. Hopefully this one will make it.

I've always loved playing board games. But in 2012 I got a bigger game as a gift, and that set it all off for me. It's not that I didn't know there was more than the usual titles, I just hadn't focused on it and had some false expectation of it all being too complicated and too long. Funnily enough, nowadays the longer games have my preference.

My collection so far isn't massive, but I'm happy with the mix between short and long, Euro and Ameri. It's hard to pick a Top 5. I think I would have at least 10 titles in my top 5.  
I've been told I explain games very well. By coincidence, I became the tutor for Learn &amp; Play events at my FLGS, and I developed my own method of conveying how to play.

I intend to keep expanding my collection, as far as is possible at the moment. My most recent play is Everdell, and it's listed as ""love to have it"" in my wishlist now. When I do get it, I'm not going dismantle that tree in fear of damaging it.  
My most recent play is ""Remember our trip"". And I should be treated to a game of Terra Mystica today. I know from other gamers that in this case Gaia Project is a better version of that game, but I haven't had an opportunity to play it yet.

Looking forward to expanding my board knowledge here!

"Few days ago I read some discussions about new Stonemaier Games title Red Rising and if it is thematic or not.

But what IS thematic?

From my perspective board games have a theme and a setting. Setting is the whole ""world"" aspect, what the flavour ""is"" - and theme is what the game ""feels"" like. Do you feel like a thief, world conqueror, tyrant, spy?

And I ended up summarizing it:

Great thematic games don't expect you to know the source material, BUT they will make you interested in the world and the source material. Otherwise it's like Fluxx games, sort of: that it has the theme and stuff makes sense, but I doubt anyone starts watching Star Trek because they played Fluxx Star Trek. 

I think THAT is what is the distinction if a game is thematic or not: whether it inspires further exploration of the theme for those not accustomed to it. Otherwise it's just a setting that will resonate with fans of source material, but is relatively abstract to everyone else.

What do YOU think makes for a thematic game?",boardgames,What makes a game... thematic? :)
"Hey guys, so basically I have more games than I will ever get through and so I've been culling (or to make it easier for me to accept, ""curating"") my board game collection, but now I've got to the point where I'm finding it hard to single any more out despite me wanting to avoid ""average"" games. 

I was hoping I could get some idea of any games you guys reckon aren't that good, or ones that have better alternatives.  
I'll post the games I have and mark which ones we play a lot, have played once or twice, or haven't had a chance to play.

I often see boardgame collections stackup in squared shelves so we decided to have something bit more organic and mixed with other things we like !  


I started this hobby about 3 years ago. I wanted to have a collection that could handle a variable number of players (1 to 8+) with different level so that if any group coming home, I would  have something to play with them. I also wanted to have an easy learning curve of various game mechanic to introduce new players for example :   
\- Card drafting : Sushi Go -&gt; Citadels -&gt; 7th wonders   
\- Engine Building : Splendor -&gt; Century Golem Edition -&gt; Terraforming Mars  
\- Worker placement : Harbour -&gt; Caverna 

Full list (From top left to bottom right) :

* Gloomhaven
* Reflet d'acide
* Tranquility
* Sherlock holmes consulting detective
* Splendor
* Sentinels of the multiverse
* Century Golem edition
* Exploding kittens
* Avalon
* Munchkin Steampunk
* Codenames
* The Mind
* Harbour
* Operation Archeo
* Magic Maze
* Citadels
* Azul
* Disney Villainous
* Robinson Crusoe
* Argent the consortium
* Spirit Island
* Dixit
* Blanc manger coco (French verions of cards against humanity)
* The Grizzled
* The 7th continent
* Mysterium
* Caverna
* Pandemic Legacy
* Sushi go
* Terraforming Mars
* 7 wonders
* Mage knight
* Rising sun

I would like to highlight few lesser known (links are to boardgamegeek.com or creator's website) :  
\- [Tranquility](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/288513/tranquility) : Cooperative card game like ""The Mind""  but less stressful. You have a grid and need to fill it up in ascending number without communicating. (Great whe like but frenchn Mother-in-law is visiting :&gt; )   
\- [The Grizzled](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/171668/grizzled) : Cooperative card game about surviving in the trenches of WWI.   
\- [Operation archeo (french)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/235830/operation-archeo) : Cooperative game about archeological excavation inspired by real ones.   
\- [Reflet d'acide (french) ](https://www.refletsdacide.com/) : It's the boardgame of an awesome french audio saga (inspired of pen&amp;paper roleplaying game). Just received it and I didn't had time to play.

Our favorite game is Mysterium (with tweaked rules and full cooperation). You can play with anybody of any level.  
The other one for more experienced players is Spirit Island.

If I had to change something I would remove Mage Knight as I took to it play solo but I just don't have the time for it and the other one is Argent the consoritum which is just too complex for the liking of my friends.",boardgames,[COMC] My humble collection
"Let me start of by thanking each and every one of you for giving us these easy-to-access games, which have proved very fun in these difficult times. I’ve gotten many friends into (virtual) boardgaming because of you!

However, this brings me to my feedback: when I find out about a game, regardless of whether or not I know the rules, I usually have no idea of the interface of the browser based version. And nobody ever offers the option of a single-player demo game for me to learn. I don’t want to jump into multiplayer games and disrupt the fun while I try to learn (strictly speaking about the interface, not rules).

There are some games where I’m actually relcutant to play with friends because I have to teach them the rules, but while doing this, I also have to find my way around the interface. And when I pass some cards to them (for example), I don’t what they see - what or where do I tell them to click? I sometimes login to the same game using multiple accounts on different browsers just so I can get see the different views of players.

So the feedback is, please add a demo game for us to fool around in. I guess the easiest way would be to start a multiplayer game with one person controlling all players.

A small addition, but would make it infintely more easier (and comfortable) to actually start learning and playing.

TL,DR: many browser-based games require a single-player demo mode so that we can learn the interface before bringing people together.",boardgames,"Dear developers who give us browser based versions of games: I love you, but I also have one feedback."

"Hi meeple people!   
Time to board broaden my mind with all the info I can get here.   
And who wants my digital hug? I've got one to give and it expires in a few hours.

I've played board games all my life. In 2012 someone gave me ""Last Night on Earth"" as a gift, and although I had always known these kind of games exist I didn't know they were so accesible. And fun! So that's when I dove deeper into board games. My current 100+ collection isn't that big compared to some, but I'm still very happy with it. It's a good mix between Euro and Ameri, short games and long games (but the long ones I prefer a bit more).

I'm also still expanding the collection. I try to compose myself with my BGG wishlist. There's also a few on there which will be hard to get (Forbidden Stars, out of print, for example). The latest addition is Everdell; played that two days ago, and really enjoyed it. And when I do get it, I'm not dismanteling that tree to put it back into the box!

It's hard to make a top 5 of favourite games, but I would say that ""A Game of Thrones - the board game"" (second edition) is my number 1. Especially with six players. I like planning and executing, also in another form like Colt Express.

By coincidence I became a teacher for board games a few years ago, giving learn &amp; play tutorials in my local board game store. I developed a certain method to best convey how a game is played. Quite often I'm a bit bothered by how games are explained to me, even through YouTube tutorials. I never find a channel that explains games the way I do and would like to be explained to. So, at the start of 2021, I decided I would become that beacon on YouTube then. Teaching how to play a game in my own particular way.

To support the channel, I made accounts on multiple social media platforms. Especially FB gives me the opportunity to reach a lot of gamers and non-gamers, with short articles on everything. Lately I've even been lucky enough to interview some people (Amsterdam's biggest game club, the owner of a big publishing company). It's become a full time (unpaid) job! I'm happy to share all links, if you're interested. I could use the followers, because most publishers won't throw me any bread crumbs until I meet their high demands.

"Wanted to show off my collection, but my original post was taken down because I misread the rules of the subreddit. With the help of the mods, I am re-posting and adding to my post to better fit the guide.

I've been a life-long board gamer, with my Dad introducing me to Avalon Hill games (his collection being mostly his games from high school and college 1965-1980, so a lot of WW2 games and Civil War and Diplomacy remaining vibrant memories of trying to play against my younger brothers with my dad as the gamemaster.)

One day, he picked up a copy of Catan upon recommendation by the local board-game shop owner and our family game nights changed. Suddenly Victory Points became a huge interest and seeing that there were all sorts of different games to play that were not strictly wargames, I broadened my interests and began my collection.

Since then, I've been collecting for 15+ years, and I tend to favor VP style Euro games of all types (light, medium and heavy crunch).  I believe Dominion was my first personally purchased game and Citadels was another one I picked up early on. 

I played a lot of tabletop war games like 40K and Warhammer but did not enjoy the long set-ups and taking down and I tend to have horrible luck with dice, so I prefer card based games. Deck-builders became my jam. However, I'd say nowadays I favor worker placement, like Lords of Waterdeep (not owned, but I like it from what I have seen) and Everdell (my current favorite). 

I'm a big fan of the Kickstarter board game community and get a lot of my new games from that, however we had the benefit of a local board game group that held raffles and we were very lucky. I'd say out of the 100+ games we own, we won at least 20 of our collection solely from attending the meetups.

"Hello! 

I am not at all a graphic designer, but I'm attempting to print a very large custom playmat with a logo + transparent layer over a background. As the logo is the only that really needs to be seen (black text and a lime green icon), I've  been trying to find a light gray textured background to put the layer behind.   


I can definitely figure out the layering part. What I can seem to be able to do is find a background layer image large enough as I'd be printing a mat that's 58""x46"" and needs to be at least 150dpi (ideally a touch higher). Does anyone have any idea where I could find such a hi-res image library for backgrounds? My google aren't turning up many images above 1920x1080.

"I finally bought all three Megaman Pixel Tactics sets and started to play the very first one (blue version) and love it.

What I am not 100% sure of is the phrasing ""...deals damage adjacent to a hero"" . Are only heroes meant that are left and right to the attacked hero or also above and below? Or also diagonally of the hero?

I understand it that only the four heroes above, below, left and right are meant. My wife says that the phrasing only refers to the heroes left and right of the attacked hero? 

So which is it? Anybody who can help me out?

"here's a bonkers variant we played with that actually worked and drastically reduced play time for this behemoth space romp.

once everything is set up, just start playing. don't worry about turn order. if it appears tharmt you're going to get each others way somehow we all just slow down and see what the most logical opinion is. but really, interaction is already fairly low in Xia and you could all be working multiple star systems away from each other. this variant assumes everyone knows the game fairly well, and of course, requires trust in your game partners, but that's never been an issue for me.

on top of cutting play time in half, it also makes the galaxy kind of just feel more alive when there's ships just zipping everywhere while you're playing. and everyone is constantly engaged and downtime is gone!

"Tldr; found a site that has saved game nights for my crew of friends after multiple attempts to play games remotely failed

Board games at my apartment were sort of the social glue of my friends group before the pandemic. I was devastated when we couldn't meet each other to continue them, but tried to save the situation by asking everyone to download Zoom and use board game sites - but inevitably, some thing always made it a very unfun experience for everyone. From technical issues like people not being able to get A/V working reliably every time, login/download frustrations to 40 minute limits on Zoom, it became more of an anxiety inducer than a fun hangout - so we just stopped and literally just fell back to voice calls with random activities like sending each other tiktok videos in the group chat and talking about them

About a month ago, a friend sent me a link to a tiktok about [https://backyard.co](https://backyard.co/) and it sounded perfect, so I tried it out with one friend first before sharing with the rest of the crew and it worked! The built-in video chat is simply genius, and the ability to switch multiple board games with a single click is \*incredible\* - our crew has gotten back to playing games together every single weekend this month and I'm happy as a clam

My biggest gripe is the lack of a mobile app, but the developers sent out an email the other day saying there is an apple and android app in the works so maybe that'll be fixed soon? The site is free so far since it's in beta, but I imagine they'll start charging for the mobile app or something in the future

Anyway, sharing here because it's been such a happy discovery and hoping I can payback some of the amazing game recs I've gotten from y'all before",boardgames,Backyard.co has revived game nights for my crew
"Hello! My girlfriend and I ([BgInsights](https://www.instagram.com/bginsights/)on Instagram ) have recently played our first game of Nidavellir, a game with limited distribution at the moment, but which made quite a bit of a splash in board gaming, recently being included on 2 of the Top 100 lists of the Dice Tower guys. 

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, Nidavellir is a drafting game in which players auction for 5 different types of dwarves. At the end of the game, each of the 5 types scores differently. Each time you get a complete set of 5 dwarves, you can immediately recruit a Hero, which is either an improved version of the regular dwarves, or it can give you some cool unique ability. 

&amp;#x200B;

The fun part is that money is never actually spent - you only auction for the shot of being the first to draft a card. This is pretty cool, as it means that you will never be out of the game, and you will be able to at least do something interesting on your turn (or at least let you set up an interesting turn in the future).

&amp;#x200B;

The game also features an interesting coin-building mechanic, in which the coins that you do not use for the auction can be used to forge a better coin (if you used during the auction your 0 value coin). This is done by calculating the sum of the 2 coins, discarding the higher value one, and getting the coin with the value of their sum.

&amp;#x200B;

It plays really quickly with 2 players - 35 minutes. The only drawback - all Heroes are available for recruiting in all games. You will usually tend to go for the same ones, especially if you play with the same person(s). More variety in that regard would have been nice. The Thingvellir expansion (which we do not have yet) seems to solve that issue, but there is definitely room for improvement.

"Hello there!

Long story short, I’m trying to create my own card game to play with my friends and family. It’s much in the spirit of Pokemon and Yugioh, with different character cards and item cards being used to attack opponents.

I want each character card to have two attacks (one more powerful than the other), but I’m having trouble figuring out a way to stop players from only ever using the heavy attack. In Pokémon this is done through the use of energy cards, but I wanted to make my game unique and not just Pokémon with different characters, so I’m trying to stay away from using energy cards.

So my question then is, does anyone have any suggestions on how to set the game up so that players have to choose between using light and heavy attacks without having to use “energy” cards to unlock either one? Any advice is greatly appreciated, thank you!",boardgames,How to approach multiple attacks without energy cards?

"So I'm making this post just to share about my experience.So to start, ever since I bought the game, the only time it has seen play was when I played it with my brother to test it out after it arrived. Whenever I play board games with my friends, there are always other games in the stack that they are more interested in and we never get around to playing Carcassonne. And then the pandemic happened and we haven't been able to get together ever since.

Recently, my mom had the idea of us playing board games in the weekends. I had shown and played some board games with her before so the idea wasn't exactly out of nowhere. We've been playing some board games in the weekends, with sometimes my grandma joining in and occasionally we convince my brother to leave his room to join us as well.

I've been introducing to them the easier games with simpler rules (definitely ain't gonna bring games like Eldritch Horror, Root, Betrayal at House on the Hill, Terraforming Mars...). One day, I introduced Carcassonne. Well, my mom fell in love with that game, with the simple rules and nice aesthetics. Ever since, we've been playing it every weekend. In fact, even though I brought Love Letter and Takenoko to the table today alongside Carcassone, we exclusively played that one, for a total of 6 rounds.   


I have Carcassonne Plus (the big box with 11 expansions) and am slowly introducing the expansions as we play. Currently we are playing with the River, Abbot and Inns &amp; Cathedrals. I'm considering adding Traders &amp; Builders next time we play.

tl;dr: Carcassonne was a game that basically never saw play at our table. But after my mother tried it, she fell in love with it and we have played it every weekend since.",boardgames,Carcassonne Suddenly a Hit at Home

* separate the remaining 6 jacks into red/black.
* shuffle remaining non-jack cards
* split non-jack deck into 2
* add a set of the 3 jacks to each stack
* shuffle each stack

Each player should have 50 cards + 2 one-eyed removal jacks + 1 two-eyes wild jack


It helps that you know your opponent has a finite number of jacks and about when they will come if the game has gone on for some time. This adds a depth of strategy and less luck.

* What about if your number is already on the top level of the tower?  Skip your turn, reroll, something else?

"Was reminiscing with a friend the other day about back in 7th and 8th grade we were addicted to the Star Wars CCG game.

I would ride my bike to the card shop in town that sold packs, and I would get there like 10 min before they opened and would buy like 2 packs a day.  I was asking my parents for early allowances, begging my sister to borrow $20, and even at some points stealing money out of my mom's purse cause I just needed to get a pack and needed to get a sweet rare card haha.

&amp;#x200B;

Now we never actually PLAYED the game, we just thought the cards were cool and collected them.  I liked how they made a unique card for basically every stormtrooper, alien, and pilot that was even given like 3 seconds of screen time in the movie.

One xmas I remember having saved up some money and I was gonna buy and entire BOX of Dagobah saga packs (forgot how many packs came in a box, but it was a goo amount).  My parents wouldn't let me and damn did I throw a FIT.  I remember yelling at them saying I hated them, etc, etc.  Come to find out they had actually already bought the box and it was my xmas gift that year.  I got basically just about every rare card from that expansion in all the packs I opened.

I got out of it shortly after after episode 1 came out and the Death Star 2 expansion saga of cards.   They had a card game for the episode 1 cards that was different too, but I did hear they later went back and redid those cards into the format of the original CCG.

&amp;#x200B;

Every now and then I get the urge to maybe buy a box on ebay or something if you can even find unopened boxes anymore.  I don't think any of the cards ended up being valuable.

that's the part that killed it for me as I remember my mother was not about to have a monthly bill for star wars games so after I went through the missions, I think she chucked it. I'd like to reexplore this now and try to find all the missions they offered.

How about a dice tower in the shape of Sauron's Tower or Smaug? These are just a few ways many players have *upgraded* their WotR game. But I went a different direction. I not only sold off my 2nd edition game in preference for my 1st edition (oh, the horror!), I also replaced all the plastic miniatures with wooden cubes and discs (egads!).

I'm sharing my photos so others can see the damage and how I've ruined my game. Surely, it's completely unplayable now.

[https://buzzfledderjohn77.imgur.com/all](https://buzzfledderjohn77.imgur.com/all)

The faction colors have small cubes (regulars), large cubes (elites), and discs (leaders). Nazgul are the only leaders on the Shadow team (red discs), and so The Witch King is also red to match the other Nazgul. Characters (gray) and Minions (black, exc WK) have an identifying sticker. Aragorn and GtW I could use white discs with stickers, but for now, I'm using the cardboard tokens that come with the game that serve no other purpose (at least, I've never used them). The Fellowship is represented by a gray disc with a sticker on each side matching its hidden or revealed status. (You can see it in Rivendell in the photos.)

I supposed I *have* upgraded to a drawbag for the Hunt tiles as well as some fancier combat dice (gifted to me by a friend).

You can see how little room the pieces take up compared to the miniatures. Most of the photos depict the starting setup (yes, I use the 2nd edition rules), but I pushed a bunch of Sauron forces over to simulate a siege on Minas Tirith.

All wooden components were purchased from [https://www.spielmaterial.de/](https://www.spielmaterial.de/)

I'm hanging on to the plastic pieces. I'm aware that my version is not friendly to any opponent who may suffer from color-blindness. If that's ever an issue, I have the minis to fall back on.

Of the 10 here, 7 had boards that wouldn’t lay flat on the table. They aren’t warped, it’s just that the folds don’t work well. 
I know there are many methods to dealing with this issue, but I don’t think any of us should have to deal with it in the first place.

But that’s had very little success.
I know this is the most first worldy problem ever but I think that publishers should also put more effort into making a good product. Most of the time this problem doesn’t effect the gameplay, although in Carpe Diem, Broom Service, and Spirit Island, their boards are small enough that the wobble will actually move tokens and cars on it around.

"If you've been in the hobby a long time you probably have some older games you haven't cracked open in forever and are just sitting sadly on the shelf, begging to be played. However I find that older style rule books are longer (FFG I'm looking at you with your 50+ page rulebooks from a decade ago), not as well layed out, and the games themselves feel quite a bit more fiddly. Often times my group wants to revisit a classic until we realize we gotta go over the rules again (meaning someone has to spend a good amount of time relearning and then teaching it again). Looking up rules videos is tedious for older games. Anyone who has been spoiled by Watch It Played, Geek &amp; Sundry, and Roll for Crit, etc may find it painful to watch older rules videos. The sound is horrible, they often aren't rehearsed, and it's just a shaky phone cam with lots of breaks for ""uhms"" and moving cards back and forth for focus. They are also often an hour long (or more!).

Because of this we've often remarked how we wish there was a channel that created these more modern types of videos for older games. One of my friends finds shooting and editing fun and we've recently decided to do this. Not for anything other than to have these vids available in the future for our group when we inevitably forget the rules, or chunks of them, and want to play again. So far we have a handful of games we are going to start shooting for. Britannia, Rune Wars, Arkham 2nd Ed, and WoW the Boardgame are a couple we are prepping for. If we have fun making them I know we will want to do more.

Are there older games you wish had modern style ""How To Play"" videos for? Which ones?",boardgames,"Which older games would you bring to the table more often if there was a modern ""How To Play"" video available?"
"Hey guys, so i am creating a board game and i want some feedback. I have two concepts:   


the first one is game which will work as simple D&amp;D and i mean it would be a really simple, because I want to make it for people which arent familiar with this concepts or they never played them before just because they think it is too much complicated. The theme would be in near future about post-apocalyptic world (not that one about zombies and mutants, but about world which was destroyed by humans and ""mother nature"") . Imagine Fahrenheit 451 but in post-apocalyptic world, where only 10% of humans still live. In this game you will have corebook which will guide you through the story, on one side the story will be written and on the other side will be a map where you would play and the same will be on the other pages. There would be some card of items, situations, and role-playing of course, with some abilities of your characters. As i said, I want to make it really easy for people who have no experience with this type.

Second one have same topic and theme, but gameplay is different. You will play as group of 3 people (so when you will play with 3 friends, every one will have his 3 characters and every character would have some unique/special skill) who will be sent for expediction to other parts of the worlds where you must find something (what, is still being discussed) and bring it back to your home of last survivers. Gameplay would look like this, you will come to specific part when you will have some locations and you must search them to find what you want. So you will go to specific place and there would be some cards, you will flip them and you can get some items to use, encouters, situations which you must solve, or that thing you are finding. When you will complete this location you can go to another. Your goal is to find all objects and bring them back from world to your settlement. 

So what do you think? Do you like these ideas? Tell me what one do you prefer more, because this research will decide what version of game i will implement. If you have some ideas i would be happy if you will share them with me and thank you for your feedback guys &lt;3.",boardgames,Creating a board game

Laying out all the pieces ahead of time so the family can see it is piquing their interest I think.  It looks great on the table.

The setup isn't as bad as I feared it would be and I was really pleased to discover that you could keep all the standees on their plastic bases and still fit them into the box!  If it had turned out you needed to remove and re-attach those bases every time I think this game might have been hard to deal with.

I know this isn't a new game of course.  But thought I'd share some pre-game observations.  Will follow up after we play a game or two.",boardgames,Getting ready for first game of Dead of Winter (pre-play review)
"With the completion (read: cancellation) of Legend of the Five Rings: The Card Game by Fantasy Flight Games, there's already another fixed-distributed non-randomized expandable card game cancelled by FFG themselves.

Maybe it's time to talk about the problem with the living/expandable/2-player card game model.

The idea of the Living Card Game formula is to eliminate the randomness of trading card games by making everything available right away in the core/starter set and expansion pack via fixed-distribution. Basically, dedicated-deck/self-contained card games with additional cards later on.

This might seem to be a cool idea on paper, but in practice, can fall short in multiple ways. But it's because it failed to appeal to two demographics, the casual and the competitive ones.

The fact that the dedicated-deck card game is collectible doesn't sound appealing for casual players who just want to play the card game right away when the expansions are released frequently and have to be bought to enjoy an increasingly full experience.

While the fact that the distribution is fixed means every card is essentially valueless to collectors are competitors alike. Collectors and investors don't have a sense of ownership to them while the competitive players don't feel special as they don't own any unique/interesting cards that make them feel superior since everyone can own everything like them.

I mean, for card games like Dominion and Wingspan, they work because they're not collectible, to begin with, and each expansion is fully loaded inside boxes. But for Legend of the Five Rings? The fact that each expansion is in booster-like packings in fixed-distribution means that it's too unaffordable and too tedious to buy for either side respectively. In the competitive spectrum, an LCG doesn't work unlike in the more casual, (sometimes) cooperative spectrum like Arkham Horror and The Lord of the Rings card games as they're essentially board games everyone can enjoy.

In the end, the story of Legend of the Five Rings card game is a sad tale and it goes to show that LCGs would need a lot of foresight to ultimately be comparable to TCGs like Magic: the Gathering in the end. And again, it's possible, just need to have a lot of thought put into them to ultimately work.

Ultimately, a card game that mixes fixed-distribution with collectibility doesn't sound like it can persist if put in the same category as TCGs.

What do you think of my analysis? Anything I missed?",boardgames,The problems with the living card game model
"After the amazing minis from C:DMD these were kind of a let down. The player pieces reuse a lot of parts (arms, backpacks and weapons) in different combinations.

"Has anyone tosssed around the idea of a phased teach up in the same vein as modern video games and now some boardgames?  Ive put this game infront of my experienced but very casual gaming friends and after a few sessions I was surprised at how abstract some of the core gameplay concepts continued to be for them. I wonder if Im not explaining everything as well as the rulebook, so sometimes I quote the rulebook if I see an idea isnt clicking. Ultimately though, one of the other three friends always “gets” any game concept I teach, so he is my barometer for my teaching. The other 3 sometimes struggle. 

My wife (an occassional but less enthused gaming partner) doesnt play in the group but will play a game with me once in a while. I dont want to scare her off this game. I was thinking that in our first game, I shouldnt implement any restrictive things like pre-requisite buildings: trellis/irrigation requirements, cellar exapansions, ancilliary buildings (tasting room, windmill, cottage, yoke), and forego the visitor cards. Perhaps playing to maybe “first to complete X wine orders (maybe 2)” 
The goal in this first bare bones game would be to emphasize the core game flow:  Plant vines. Harvest fields. Make Wines. Age grapes/wines; Fill wine orders. 

For casuals there is enough meat here that is still abstract, like field capacity (5/6/7), “summing” red/white values into singular grape values, combining grapes to make blush and sparkling. 

Without buildings in this first game, it might limit the usefulness of money, so Id emphasize that money is used to hire more workers and just leave it at that for now. Expanding your number of workers is a key concept in many worker placement games, so thats easily grasped. 

The subsequent teach would incorporate either the “restrictive” buildings (ie the vine pre-requisite bulidings and cellar improvement buildings) or the “permissive” buildings (cottage, yoke, windmill, tasting room) but perhaps not both. Then money becomes more relevant. 

Third ... not quite sure if Id introduce the other buildings, or the Visitors, or both.... and increasing end-game/win comditionss. Really though, at this point you should be able to know if this game’s core gameplay is enjoyed by your group or not

"Hi all,

We've nearly finished the story of the campaign mode for **Maracaibo** with my partner and although it kept us playing the game out of curiosity (and because we like the game), the story itself was not very good. It's not well written, so either what happens is boring, or there's a plot twist that's badly set up and explained so it doesn't make a big impression and most of the time our reaction was something between ""who's that again?"" and ""ok I guess so"".

"Hi everyone :) I know this question has probably been asked ad infinitum over here. I did some googling but I wanted more specific answers in case you guys are willing to share. 

Lately my gf has been hooked on board games after playing Coup, Pandemic, Wingspan, Everdell, and Arkham Horror, Goodcritters. 

I think the game that finally converted her into the hobby would be Wingspan. From the way I see it, she likes it because it’s not “fiddly”. I understand that Wingspan is pretty light weight but I share the same sentiment as her that games shouldn’t be too fiddly unless it’s justified. 

She likes:
Coup because of its social deduction. She likes to feel clever. This might be her favourite game. 

Pandemic she is okay to meh about it. Sometimes she wants to play it but I’m not convinced it’s super fun for her. Maybe she’s into competitive rather than co-op

Everdell. She finds this game tedious. But it’s her first worker placement and tableau building game. 

After Everdell I went ahead and bought Wingspan despite her complaining that she hates Victory Points games. I felt Everdell was her first game and she only play the game once. Maybe she still needed warmup. And sure enough she LOVE Wingspan. But she’s fickle so idk how long. 

Goodcritters. She love this one a lot. Because she gets to talk and feel clever. 

Arkham horror the card game. She said she enjoys exploration game and don’t mind it. But she hate having to deck built and leave it to me to deck built for her. 

I’m looking at some other games to expand our collection. Her interest are not the same as mine but I’m willing to play anything she chooses. 

What are some good games for consideration?

We are getting Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective next but she asks me to get one more game. I need help deciding on the second game.

Because I’ve been working a ton, she has been playing with mom more than myself but my daughter asked me to play Ticket to Ride today.

About a third of the way into the game it was 42-25 in my favor and my daughter said: “My stomach kind of hurts, I don’t want to play anymore,” and then the minutes later she is running around with her sister.

I spoke with my wife who says: “She’s 9 years old of course she doesn’t want to play if she’s losing. If you don’t want to play games with her because she’s a quitter, then don’t.” I personally think it might be wiser to force her to play any game to its fruition to teach her once you start something you finish it but I’m coming here asking for any thoughts/opinions/criticisms on what might be the best option to do.

I've heard several others in this subreddit talk about their shelf of shame and I happen to have one too. I've heard some of these games are great. Some have been given to me as gifts and others I have bought myself. I try and play everything at least once but some games keep going to the bottom of the pile and they never get opened. I generally try not to open and punch a game until just before playing so it makes it a bit easier to keep track of what I haven't played. This question came to mind when I saw someone post about arctic scavengers. It made me realize that I've had this game for roughly 6 years now and still haven't played it. This got me thinking... surely there couldn't be a bigger offender than that in my collection. Then I found Yedo. A game that I actually opened and read the rules for but never managed to get a group to the table to play. I've had it for 8 years now and with the pandemic still here I can't even say I can plan to play it anytime soon. So what's your biggest offender on your shelf?,boardgames,Unplayed games: What is your oldest owned on your 'shelf of shame'?

"The wife and I didn't really enjoy ""going easy"" on the kids. Instead, we adults give it our best and the kids play their hardest. Our board games finish in a dead heat and we all have an even shot at winning. Lots of excited shouting when we are neck-and-neck at the end of a game. We're starting to add monthly prizes because we're all pretty close at the end of the month. All thanks to handicaps.

I had been keeping score on a spreadsheet for a while. So I simply made a formula in the spreadsheet. It takes the past 5 matches of each game and calculates the average score across all players. Then it calculates each individuals player's average over their past 5 matches. Finally **each player is assigned an adjustment which is 90% of the difference between their recent average and the game's recent average**. 

BOOM! It's that easy.

Each game has a different adjustment because the spreadsheet automatically calculated a new handicap when I entered the scores after the last game.  

* **Point Adjustments** \- If you've been in a golf league you're familiar with this. For games with victory points the formula gives weaker players the number of points to even their odds. For example **Azul, Carcassonne, and Sushi Go Party,** we just start with points already on the board (then subtract them when entering the scores onto the spreadsheet). 
* **Staggered start** \- If you've ever been in an amateur racing club you're probably familiar with this handicap (e.g. where each racer starts at a different number of seconds after the firing gun). For some turn based board games we give the weaker players a head start with extra turns (for example **Sorry! or Monopoly**) This one is a bit less accurate but to be honest we don't pull those games off the shelf much anymore.
* **Adjusted Win Threshold -** For board games where the first person to reach a certain number of points then the formula says how many points every player must reach. For example in **""Kids Against Maturity**"" (it's like ""Cards Against Humanity"" but with poop humor for kids) we have to get 5 cards to win but this past match my daughter (who usually dominates) had -1 handicap on the spreadsheet so she had to get 6 cards and my son (who is young and is always behind) had a +1 handicap so he only had to get 4 cards to win. We each had had victory within our grasp, everyone was one card away from their threshold, when my daughter clinched it (again).
* **Blended -** Other games with a threshold of points to win, like **Catan**, we not only adjust the required number of points to win but also give a head start. For example my handicap is currently calculated at -3 and my son is +1. We had tried to play that so that I need to reach 13 points and he needs 9 to win. But instead we took one of those VP's and turned them into a head start. My son starts with one of his settlements as a city and needs to reach 9 points while I need to reach 12 points to win. Both of the kids start with a city, actually - it makes the game faster. Our last game was down to the wire at the end! 
   * I am MOST proud of this one.
* **Removing pieces -** There have been hundreds of years of best practice in handicapping **Chess**. Depending on the difference in win rate between players we simply remove an appropriate piece (for example against my wife I currently have to remove one of my pawns, against my son I currently have to remove one of my rooks.  I know that currently handicapping the timer is a more popular method in chess, but we don't play with a timer because the kids choke under the time pressure.
* **Physical handicaps -** Just like handicaps in amateur horse races (where faster horses run with lead weights in the saddle). For dexterity games we apply actual physical handicaps. For example in **Jenga** I can only use my left hand against the kids (until they get better, at least). In **""Juice Pong""** (*yes, uh, it's like what you played at University, but with juice*) the adults have to stand further back when they shoot and the kids can lean over the table. This one is more of an art not a formula, we do it based on observed skill and the recent win percentage shown on the sheet but they get the desired results.
* **Work in progress -** Card games are harder to handicap. We're still trying to perfect a system because I murder the kids in **UNO** no matter what we try. We have tried giving the kids +4 cards then dealing, we've tried giving them fewer cards to start. Next we're going to try giving them tokens to replace their hand (for example if they only have 5 cards of one color they can discard and pick up 5 new cards). We haven't played much **Exploding Kittens** but I assume we can just give an extra diffuse but I don't have a feel for what percentage difference would be required for that. Also, I have no clue how to handicap **One Night Ultimate Super Villains.** Anyway, recommendations welcome.
* **#notallgames -** Not every game benefits from a handicap. **Munchkin** pretty much ends with everybody at 10 points and at some point everyone just runs out of poop to fling at other players and that's when one lucky individual crawls over the finish line. TBH, we just play Munchkin to 5 points instead of 10 and it's pretty much the same game but the slog to the endgame is a few minutes shorter. Handicaps don't help much here in my opinion.

Searching for past posts about handicaps in this forum I see that lots of people are against handicaps. Why would anybody be against making the game equally competitive for everyone at different levels? Many of the arguments I saw against handicaps made no sense. Some people said that it makes the game too easy for weaker players who won't learn if they ""get a handout"". Look, my experience is that the kids have to bring their ""A game"" in order to win against me because I'm not leaving anything behind on that board. They KNOW **they have to come in under par by more points than everyone else in order to win**. So they're constantly improving, learning new techniques, and practicing how not to fumble, in order to beat their recent averages. I'd say the kids were more discouraged when I had a leg up on them, permanently - this way we're all constantly on even footing while they improve.

Hopefully my experience helps other people to even the odds when they play with friends/family of varying skill. Instead of just blindly giving weaker players an arbitrary large number of points, please consider a spreadsheet with a simple formula: **90% of the delta between a player average and the game average over the past 5 games**. Feel free to ask me followup questions.",boardgames,"It's not fun to ""go easy"" when playing the kids. Here's my success story about handicaps calculated on a spreadsheet."
"We have noticed the following problem in our games. We have two plays who really like each other, and when the game begins, they declare ""alliance"". While the ""alliance"" is not perfect, it means they will usually invest more in interfering with other players than each other.

This tends to become a serious problem when one of them is Khorne, because Khorne has a very strong ability to influence the game, almost guaranteeing for sure that one of these two will win. The worst case is when the two allies are Khorne and Nurgle, with Khorne leaving Nurgle alone in return for Nurgle sending warriors to help Khorne. 

How can the rules of the game work against such a Cartel? Note that trying to convince the players to stop doing this is not working since this Cartel seems to benefit both of them, so you can't convince them that one of them is taking advantage of the other.

I have thought about a few ideas on how to handle such a cartel, but I'd be glad to hear your opinions as well. My ideas are, ordered by most to least preferrable:

1.  Order Khorne:   
\- Khorne can no longer gain dial or VP, note that Khorne can still dominate a region.  
\- Khorne wins if the world won.   
\- Khorne gets an upgrade every 2 rounds.   
\- Cultists remove 1 corruption instead of placing it.  
\- Skull Throne (Attack = domination) is replaced with ""Increase resistance by 2"".  
\- Reborn In Blood (Attack twice) is replaced with ""Remove 4 corruption"".  
\- One less old world card in the game.
2. Mute Chaos: Players are not allowed to talk. If players don't talk, then the Cartel can synchronize less, which will eventually lead to internal struggles.
3. Change Khorne dial condition: Khorne gets dial counters per unique number of players killed (maybe even getting 4 if he attacks all 3) . This is a problem because the Cartel can still have a deal where one of them constantly puts one cultist out for column in return for protection. It also doesn't help if Khorne or his friend are going for VP (we have some changes to the game to encourage that).",boardgames,Chaos In The Old World: How does one handle a Khorne Cartel?

* Cosmic Encounter (Loves stacking all the different colored ships)
* Azul (this one didn't hold his attention for too long, but he liked messing with the pieces and placing them on the boards

"I remember playing ticket to ride as a teen and hating the VP track. It just seemed so worthless. In fact, most times we would just wait until the end and count it all up at once. There are countless other games that have this decorative vp track around the edge. 

The first game I remember playing that changed this up was Terra Mystica. During setup, you place your VP marker at 20 and then during setup and gameplay, you can choose to strategically spend vps for other benefits.  This was mind blowing to me. Having to make the decision of giving up hard earned VPs for long term gain was such an interesting one. 

A few other examples: 

Terraforming Mars uses the vp track as your base income for each round. 

Scythe doesn’t have a VP track, but it’s based on total money at the end.  Every coin you spend is a potential victory point.

"Like many of you I enjoy tracking my plays and looking at statistics. Some of you use spreadsheets, some BoardGameGeek and some such as myself use apps. For the last 4 years or so I've been using BG Stats. It's a fine app, but I felt it was lacking in some key areas; most notably more complex scoresheets and expansion plays.

So I decided to solve this problem by developing my own app.

**Introducing [Board Record!](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/QBQJicOvCls_XocbjwozSu-0G0NaWzVJzN1xznD6X4IwGQ8_HURH8AZZLWcQzf-cSqh9=w2560-h1329-rw)**

It's currently Android only and in beta. Feel free to jump right over to the **[Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trafford.boardrecord)** page and try it out.   
  
It has all the standard features such a tracking your collection, recording plays/players and locations and syncing with **BoardGameGeek**. These are all free to use, as are the features described below.  

There is a premium version, currently this doesn't do much more than remove the ads (which are pretty unobtrusive, no full screen or timed ones). But I do plan on adding some additional features and stat filtering to premium. Until then, it's half price.  
**I also have 20 codes to the first 20 people to comment on this post to unlock it for free!**
  
[Scoresheets](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/D4o-F2uItp3Gf8lcRcFTV-z3mKKhAuy1OcCqPacHfKDetzDc9-TG5ckTHe1JO1k1zIw=w2560-h1329-rw)

The main feature of Board Record is scoresheets. This was somewhat inspired by ScorePal, however I felt it was rather clunky and lacking in the stats department. Board Record allows you to create ""rounds"" for games which can be an actual round like in Jaipur or a ""scoring category"" like in 7 wonders. With this you can view stats on a per round basis rather than just by total scores.

[Per round stats.](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/q0hm2Kg3FB80uKZYvvCtrkNgze83jotQOSLNXEKrBoCmXbFFg2H4WEW54y_vcUnd91U=w2560-h1329-rw)

The other main feature is expansion plays. While BG Stats allowed me to enter a text entry for ""variant"" on plays, it did nothing with this value and had no real concept of expansions. In Board Record when you select an expansion it links to an actual game and when you view stats for that game it will include all plays for which it was used as an expansion. You can even log these plays to BGG as a 0 qty play. Filtering and comparing stats by expansions used is a planned feature.

[Tags](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/S_8-TSOAe1jqL6hNX18zuuHesAFSVkDy99GbHFNlp-WrIDIJnJurSQBmhyek-JRxsa0=w2560-h1329-rw)

I've also implemented a tag system for plays which can be used to visualise any additional data you like. For example I use it to record how a game of Spirit Island ended (Terror I, Terror II, Terror III, Fear for wins and Blight, Spirit Death and Time for losses).


Some other features of interest.   
It has a random start player picker. I've always been interesting in how often the start player wins in games,but I often found myself forgetting to record you went first. In Board Record since I now use the app to decide who goes first, it automatically records it.  
It has a [Game Picker](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/xb7agXBRZuremefUBDjTEODriNuFQniYxtE7oxDsBg-WZEPKZG2reGAAfC2lA9tsWrI=w2560-h1329-rw) which can randomly select a game to play based on filter criteria such as player count and duration.

So please try it out and don't hesitate to let me know of any issues or if you have any suggestions.

I'm looking for recommendations for music or soundtracks to play during a game of 'Wingspan'.

Just recently got into the hobby from watching No Rolls Barred on YouTube. I've picked up the tidbit that music (especially thematically appropriate music) can make a board game pop.

I'd like to know if the 2x malformaitons of G is necessary to enjoy the scenario? I noticed that it has the 4 other form of G, while only the 3rd form is present in the core set. 

Does this mean that we won't encounter any other form of G in the main playthrough if we don't buy the expansion? or they do have the different form, but just use the same token?

Regarding the other expansion (4th survivor, etc.), it seems they just add more playable characters or monsters which I don't think is essential. please let me know if these are actually needed? Any other good expansion I should look into?

"Here's the rub, I'm a map nerd. I studied them in my college studies, I use them occassionally in my job, and I love geeking out over excellence in the visual art of maps in the board game hobby. I don't think beautiful maps get enough credit for the weight they pull in the hobby (just a humble opinion). The good news is there is an embarrassment of amazing maps in board games. Like, so many that I'm going to struggle not to ramble so here it goes.

In my mind, a great map is:

* aesthetically beautiful;
* intensely functional (do the appropriate bits fit while the map retains its functionality?);
* thematically appropriate;
* easy to read and understand;
* proper use of iconography where appropriate; and 
* conveys its intended information.

Here are my top maps in board games.

1. **War of the Ring (Second Edition).** This is one of those maps that takes your breath away when you see it on the table. The size is enormous, but not unnecessarily so. The size is a requirement of allowing all but the largest armies of Middle Earth to fit inside of its provinces. And even if you have an army too large, there are sections of the board reserved for setting those massive armies so the player can instead move a number token. The provinces are shaped like real-life city-states and it makes you feel like you're presiding over the general's map of Middle Earth, each with an actual name. Nothing ruins a map like blob-shaped provinces. Towns have different shapes than settlements. The map illustrates mountains and forests and uses them to form borders without becoming visually overwhelming. And the best part is the map seamlessly incorporates important story elements from the decks of cards and creates both a compelling storytelling narrative, as well as an interesting strategy game with dudes on a map. This to me is in the S-Tier of board game maps. [https://boardgamegeek.com/image/5821542/war-ring-second-edition](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/5821542/war-ring-second-edition)
2. **Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition).** If GoT and Diplomacy had a beautiful love child that would someday mount the world. Sometimes I just set this board on the dining room table and let it sit out for a day to appreciate it. As a GoT fan, this map is one of the best examples of the merging of theme and function. Overwhelmingly the provinces make sense (the  Stark's large and vast, the Tyrell's in cradle of resources). The iconography of the crowns, forts, castles, and barrels are easy to read and located in places that fit with the theme. Each house has geographical challenges and advantages, but at the end of the day, this map isn't about perfect balance, as the game allows the players to work against those in possession of power. The color palette and aging of the map also make you feel like you've sat around an old heavy oak table to discuss your war plans. Every game day a little part of me hope someone requests GoT regardless of the player count, just to get a chance to sit in front of this board and feel connected to the world. [https://boardgamegeek.com/image/1226534/game-thrones-board-game-second-edition](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/1226534/game-thrones-board-game-second-edition)
3. **Kemet.** Kemet is in the less traditional line of maps than my first two choices, but I think it deserves a spot at the top all the same. Kemet knows and understands its aesthetic and keeps in theme with all the card art and figurines. The interesting thing that Kemet does is it seeks to create a map where turtling is minimized and it does this by making every player the same number of moves away from one another. It takes a shift in mindset to fully get on board, but once you do it's liberating. The color's are vibrant and contrast nicely with the markings. Again the province sizes are perfect for what they're accomplishing. Here meandering borders wouldn't make much sense since the scale is much smaller, so the straight borders don't bother me. Icons are beautifully placed in temples to remind you of temporary and permanent point gains, as well as any prayer point generation. Even small touches like leaving an outline for each pyramid are what elevate the best maps and make them just a touch more easy-to-use and can often to be the difference between making it to the table or not. The actual game and the miniatures are all incredible, but because of that I think this map often get's overshadowed. [https://boardgamegeek.com/image/1444524/kemet](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/1444524/kemet)

Okay, I've rambled enough. Agree or disagree? Is my criteria garbage and off-base? What games do you think feature exceptional maps, in both theme, function, and beauty? I can't meet up with my game group so I need to talk board games!

"My wife and I are total noobs to Arkham Horror (the card game) and are playing the first campaign, Night of the Zealot.  We are on the third chapter... we did reasonably well on the 1st two chapters (despite making a couple of major errors in the game play and having to restart) and overall love the game.  

But in the 3rd chapter we are getting destroyed... horrible string of bad luck.  After 35 minutes we have only collected 2 clues and we've triggered the last card of agenda stack.  On our investigations we managed to pull the token that adds a doom to the agenda 4 times, and we've drawn several cards from the encounter deck that result in doom tokens.  Needless to say, we don't have nearly enough time left to work on our act deck.  Both of our characters have taken a bunch of damage, mostly from failing trials.

This is a 'big picture' question... not a question of following the specific rules.  What happens in the big picture if we resign?  We're done and we box up the game, feeling oh-so-excited that our last experience was an ass-kicking?  There doesn't seem to be any way to replay the chapter if we resign, so what is the point of resigning?  Is it something to do with the expansion game after Night of the Zealot?  

We have read about 10 articles on line (many of Reddit, several on BGG) that try to explain how all the expansions and mythos packs work, and it is so confusing.  Is this one long adventure like Gloomhaven?  Or is each expansion a stand-alone?  Do the characters continue through all of them, with continually expanding/improving card decks?

I'm certain that people who have a lot of experience with these games will find this really simple, but we can't make any sense of it.  And some other questions (answers to these seem to be cryptic or just assumed online, so we can't find qualified answers):

1) As Roland, I have a deck of 30-ish cards that I have been working on.  That deck... will I use it again after the Night of the Zealot?  Or will the deck start over?

2) Can we (or should we) just start over at the beginning of  NotZ with new characters and play everything again, even though we know all the 'spoilers'?  If so, where do we keep those stats?  Is this what the creators intended?

3) If I want to play the character of Roland again for a repeat of NotZ would I start a new stack of 30 cards, but with only level-0 cards?

4) we are tracking things like mental trauma.  Why?  If we only ever bought NotZ and never bought another expansion or mythos pack or anything, what would be the point of tracking stats?

5) was the NotZ published with the full knowledge that there would be expansions right away that could be purchased?  Is that why there are so many extra chaos tokens? Is this game just a big teaser for what is to come?

6) is it just me, or does the single campaign of NotZ seem rather limited in size/time considering the box and price?  Gloomhaven, albeit expensive, provided us with hundreds of hours of content.  Pandemic Legacy has around 20-30 hours of content.  We have spent a total of about 4 hours playing NotZ and we are starving for more.  This is why we are wondering if we missed something.  Chapters 1 and 2 were relatively easy (we never got close to dying, and solved both with time to spare) and chapter 3 beat us in about 30 minutes. We feel like it should have been more.  Seemed like an amazing appetizer course. We must be missing something.

Thank you for helping us understand the big picture.  We have ordered several expansions, but they won't be here until March, so we're now looking at the box, wondering what more we can do.  4 hours, no matter how amazing it is, doesn't seem near enough (especially considering the $35 spent).

And this is not a knock on the game.... we love it!  We just seem to be missing something and we need help filling in the gaps.

Thank you again.",boardgames,Arkham Horror (card game) noob question... what happens when you resign on the last chapter?

"Strong recommend!  My three children (11,13,15) and I have played about 1/3 of the legacy / campaign game.  For those unfamiliar, the basic gameplay is similar to the old Tetris video game.  Each player has an identical set of building tiles.  There's one card corresponding to each building.  The goal is to get as many buildings on the board as possible while not covering 'good' tiles (like trees) but covering 'bad' tiles (empty space, rocks).

There's no higher praise for a family-appropriate game than to say your kids ask to play it when you weren't even thinking about it.  There are two aspects in particular that are worth highlighting.  One is that the game has built-in equalizers to handicap players who win and boost players who don't win.  These take the form of stickers that you apply to the board (or don't) and also new buildings that vary slightly from one player to the next.  The other thing is that the rules change, sometimes slightly, sometimes dramatically, from one game to the next.  Nothing that complicated, but enough to keep everyone on their toes and force them not to rely on the same approach.

Meanwhile, I constantly see here on reddit and on facebook people asking for game recommendations and those threads get so long that I can't imagine the person asking is anything but overwhelmed! As the person not asking, I'll usually give a glance at a thread, upvote the thing I would have said, then get bored pretty quick and move on to something else.

"Hi,


Got a copy of blood rage and totally love the game! My group and I do have some questions however:


1) when playing a leader upgrade, does that cost the blood rage listed on the card or is it free since Leaders invade for free? 


2) Do clan stat upgrades take effect the second you get them? For example if I pillage a Horns token, would that make it so my number of allowed figures is up for the current round or next? Same for blood rage. If I pillage a blood rage token do I get the increase in that turn or starting next turn? 


3) if someone pillages do you need to join the fight if you’re already in that province? For example if someone pillages, and my ship is there, do I automatically join the battle? 


4) during a battle am I required to play a card or can I not play one?

While I really enjoy the game I do think the way it is boxed could have had some more attention.

So I decided to improve the way the game components are divided in the original box by using parts of a Spirit Island box. This way I can easier setup and start games as things are sorted better.

"I've been playing board games since I was a kid, but it wasn't until 2016 that I started investing in my hobby. I started by buying games that I found interesting for the cover and the theme, without worrying too much about style and mechanics itself. I really regretted it and bought a lot of games that I didn't like in the first year of collection.

Over the years, I refined my taste and, helped by my wife, we created our collection with a limit of 20, then 50, 75, 100 and finally our limit became the physical space we had. The games were divided into 2 shelves and another chest that was in the TV room. It got to a point that not only bothered me that they were separated, but also the physical space for bigger games was a big problem (especially with the arrival of the Anachrony Infinty Box).

So, after moving to a bigger house, I decided to invest in a bookcase that had space for all games, with plenty of room for bigger games, and with some extra space for new purchases.

[One Shelfie to bring them all!](https://preview.redd.it/lacqblfjm3i61.jpg?width=696&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60a29a882142ef0195dc9ba15301b8b978c1913b)

As you can see, our taste is much more for euro games, family games and a just a few small games are accepted. We play a lot more between us 2 than with other people, but when we play with friends we like games with less interaction, but still competitive. Personally, I like heavy euros and economic games, although I don't like Splotter games. My wife certainly prefers the multiplayer solitaire euros and more casual games and family ones, although recently she asked me to buy one or the other heavier game when the theme is of her interest.

We both like games by Vital Lacerda and Alexander Pfister, although the designer does not always define our purchases. We like some Feld games, but most of us don't (because of the interaction or because the game is very punitive). We really like Martin Wallace's games, but again, not all end up being what we expect and there is a big problem that many games by the author are for 3 or more players. To be in the collection, games must be for 2 or more and must be good with this configuration. Some rare exceptions are made when the game is very good (Die Macher, for example).

You may be asking yourself, ""where are the expansions""? They went back to the chest. We have defined that only expansions that do not fit in the base game box will remain on the shelf. All the empty boxes came out so as not to take up space.",boardgames,Finally I managed to put all my games together in one place

"I was lucky enough to be able to move to Japan for work as of a couple months ago. The move has been good - but as it will be only for a few years, and I moved into an already furnished place, there wasn't really a good excuse to pay for a whole lot of freight. This meant that my relatively sizeable collection of games, which I've been slowly gathering since around 2010, had to be mostly sold off or long-term-loaned out to friends.

[Here's what's left](https://imgur.com/gallery/EhaGBni) \- plus a few extra bits I've picked up since arriving.

**What do I miss most? Terraforming Mars**. I used to play the solo probably a couple times a week. I still do the digital solo every now and then, and have been playing it with a friend recently online - but it's not the same joy as those tactile pieces and the giant table-consuming tableau that unfolds before you as the game progresses. I've gone in for the **Ares Expedition** kickstarter and am looking forward to getting at least a little bit of that itch scratched. Hopefully that takes up a little less table space than the original: While I have a decent sized apartment *for Japan* it's still not easy to get a big table here.

**What are the most recent additions?**  I've been pretty blessed to have a bunch of folks give me games they weren't playing (turns out young parents are understandably quite time-poor people). **Carcassonne: The Discovery**, with the rules ""choose what to play from your 2 face up tiles"" variant is absolutely my favourite way to play 2p Carcassonne. I also nabbed the latest Japanese edition of **Little Town** which is fabulous. It seems the main criticism of the international release was it felt a little simple and undercooked - but with a bunch of extra bits packed in the Japanese version is a delightful, relaxed little engine builder. 

**What's on the pile of shame?** Even though the collection was closer to 80ish games back home, our regular group was pretty good at ensuring everything got played at least a couple times. Such a good group is a rare prize though. It's much harder to get a game going here - so **PatcHistory** and **Vermillion: Legend of Galactic Heroes** (which is in Japanese so will likely require a few weekends to translate) remain unplayed. I also got **Neanderthal** just before leaving, thinking it would be a great small-footprint game to play solo, but I haven't yet found the time to really sit down and learn it. **Roads to Lord** is a Japanese language card-driven roleplaying game which will likely never hit the table. My Japanese is sketchy at best, and while I'm studying daily - it sounds like the rules were confusing even for native Japanese readers. Perhaps a retirement project to tickle the braincells when I dust it off in decades future?

**Any recent surprises?** Carl Chudyck's games seemed ideal for this move: Thinky, deep and in a very small pack. Shortly after arriving we played **Mottainai** and my wife just hated it. Understanding there were strong similarities between Chudyck's games I thought **Innovation** would also be a wash as well, but no - she quite enjoyed it! It seems the trick was that Mottainai's shorter play time means each move feels more restrictive - because each move offers your opponent so much. Innovation on the other hand gives you a little more time to try stuff, so it feels easier take more risks even if they offer your opponent a brief advantage.

**What would I change if I could?** I brought a bunch of great simple social games in case I had occasions to invite groups of people over and make friends that way: Codenames, The Resistance, Cockroach Poker, Spaceteam... Unfortunately because I came from Australia I just sort of forgot COVID was a thing. Between that and the language barrier (my Japanese is about on par with a particularly sleep-deprived toddler) I should have instead focused on bringing over more great 2p games to soak up the cruisy weekend afternoons with my wife.",boardgames,[COMC] after trimming down my entire life to two suitcases!

"My board games and role play groups have been managing appointments via WhatsApp, via Google Calendars and even via Doodle in the last years. However this was a permanent challenge, because:
- WhatsApp and Messenger Apps are quiet confusing in large groups
- Google Calendars are not easy to maintain (many clicks just to create an ""I am Available"" Appointment
- On Doodle you have to create new polls every time you are looking for an appoint.

So we were looking for an app that provided:
- a neverending calendar, without the need to create dates/polls
- a very fast and intuitive way to vote for or against a date, ideally by swiping either left or right
- real time updates to keep every group member up to date about the other's votes
- A simple overview about who is available when

Since we play in the evenings after work, the main challenge was just to find a common date. The concrete time is usually easily discussed and decided in WhatsApp. So we created a small app that does support exactly that. It's public and free soif you want to try it out, please feel free to sign up, create your calendar and invite your friends with an invitation link.

After years of sourcing, molding and costing, I am so happy that [Block and Key](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/insideupgames/block-and-key?ref=f1qdfj) finally launched on Kickstarter today! And I am even more excited by the reception its received from reviewers and backers alike! 

[Kickstarter Main Image](https://preview.redd.it/klwj7pymq5i61.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17da65a17da0f0a57f0be65a67496ba519e10208)

In [Block and Key](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/insideupgames/block-and-key?ref=f1qdfj) 1 to 4 players will compete by drafting blocks from the Excavation Site (box bottom), and playing them one at a time into a shared space - The Temple Floor (box top).

What makes the game interesting and unique is that each player sits on their own side of the ""Ruins"" (box structure) and therefor has their own perspective of the board. It is from THEIR 2D perspective that players will be trying to complete their Key Cards for Victory Points, and also setting up their Enigma (end game bonus).

The art and graphic design merge seamlessly to help teach and remind players throughout the setup and game. The action options are depicted along the sides of the box bottom, the placement rules along the sides of the box top, and then End Game trigger down the support columns. The box top has iconography hidden in to help with set up for player count, and AI directions for solo play. You won't really notice them if they aren't needed, but they are quickly seen when needing a reminder!

The deluxe Kickstarter launched today (Feb 17th, 10 AM EST) and is already fully funded. I wanted to drop this in here to let people know that if they pledge for a copy of the game ($42 USD) in the first 24 hours of the campaign they get the Day One Backer Bonus of having their name printed inside the game box!

"The two main reasons I can see is: 
-the lasting effect of COVID-19 and how that will effect social areas like tables and free-play board games. Even as countries are getting vaccinated and it's getting better, social distancing rules and general caution will probably still be a priority for years.
-online sales and kickstarter driving sales out of the FLGS hands. (Many Kickstarters have FLGS options, but not only are those relatively high cost, they are very high risk for the store).  As we all know, profits from board games alone have been abysmal for ages, and it's only getting worse.

MTG is commonly referred to as being the lifeblood of most FLGS's, but even that's getting less profitable I hear, and the whole COVID thing has slowed that down too, and it will continue to for a long time.

"Personally, mine hasn't been so great. And I think I have it boiled down to a few points: 1- Learning the game. 2- Tactile bias. 3- People.

Learning the rules of a boardgame is a fairly unique experience, and almost a skill in itself. The nature of tabletop gaming forces you to constantly check the rulebook to tighten up your understanding. When I tried the digital version of Scythe for the first time, I immediately felt lost and wished I had a quick way to check the rulebook, but that required leaving the game and opening a PDF. And since the app game itself could handle a lot of the rules for me, there was less incentive to check the rules. I adopted a learn-as-you-go method similar to how videogames usually work. But it just doesn't work the same for boardgames. 

Still after a few plays, I started to get the rules down. But the AI opponent would still stomp me. Losing is fine, but having no idea how you lost is frustrating, because there's nothing to learn from. Because the game is digital, there was some iconographic differences from the tabletop version. Tabletop games need to be easily read and understood at a glance, while the digital version sent that task to different menus. This also contributed to making the learn-as-you-go method more difficult.

Then, there's the tactile bias. I think even if you were to port a near perfect boardgame to digital, it's still going to lose points because you are missing the tactile element of tabletop gaming. In other words, I started to wonder if Scythe was as good of a game as others have had me believe, or was it getting by on how visually beautiful and satisfyingly tactile it is? I've played and loved games like Scythe before --count up your points at the end of the game and see who wins-- but suddenly with the digital version, I was finding myself evaluating how much fun I was really having just sort of scoring points for the sake of scoring points. 

I think a larger part of what makes boardgames great is the people. Not only are you having conversation and laughing, but beating someone irl is far more satisfying (or maybe it makes you feel bad) no matter the method- scoring more points, reducing their health, etc. Playing the digital version really highlighted this for me, because I was not having any fun scoring points on an iPad. 

I also tried Root and Mystic Vale and I had similar results. Root had a very long tutorial and I just lost my patience. Mystic Vale was more of a success but I had a similar issue of not easily being able to know how I was being beat. Again losing is fine, but it sea easier to strategize and learn from loses at the table, for reasons that I don't really know. 

Shards of Infinity is amazing on the table or in the app. Just an all around great game, but being a card game I think separates it from the issues I'm having with digital boardgames. 

TL; DR Boardgames are harder to learn in their digital versions, and less fun because you don't get the tactile response and you aren't talking to people.

Now I know this isn't exactly a revelation, but I was wondering if other people had the same experience?",boardgames,How has your experience been with digital boardgames?

"Sorry, this is going to be a bit of a rant about frustrations with my family, but I wonder if any of you guys can relate...

So I somehow got into watching board game videos during the first lockdown and they honestly got me through. There's no politics, no taking yourself too seriously, no meanness, I'm just totally sold on the wholesome beauty of board games, pretty much based on YouTube and my own imagination. I love the whole idea of board games. I think they're beautiful and an interesting way to spend time.

So now we have bubbles in the UK and my best friends are spread throughout the country so I now spend most weekends at my parent's. We've never been a very active family, more into watching TV all night, and never really held any proper traditions of routines. So I've started my collection, hoping to establish a game night.

I got Skull and Don't Get Got to play at Christmas. By the time Christmas came we couldn't have anyone over so Don't Get Got didn't work - I was hoping for a week of hilarity with a decent sized group from this. We played a round of Skull with my folks, my sister and her bf. This was pretty good, but it was so late in the evening, just not quite the tense biker show-down SUSD had me hoping for.

Next purchase: Cockroach Poker and Decrypto. My folks were trying to get a Friday Night Dinner going with the 4 of us. My sister works at my parent's house. So I show up on Friday evening, we have dinner, and I want to get an after dinner game out. My dad has to go for a work call (he works way too much at anti-social hours but that's another rant) so my mum and sister enthusiastically humour me and let me do the teach for these two games, they're loving the mechanics and the design, but I just put them away because I don't want to do a non-optimal 3p first game.

Next weekend, I suggest we do Sunday lunch, so everyone isn't tired from a full day of work. Except it's Valentine's Day, so Sis feels bad about being away from her bf for too long, obviously dad has a work call in the middle of the afternoon, so by the time we've had our lunch, we literally played a hand of Cockroach Poker, everyone kinda got the mechanic, then said ""gotta go."" I begrudgingly got it out because they insisted, because I'm so into doing a games night and they want to appease/humour me, but I was just so much more fed up when it wasn't the games night(/afternoon) I had in my head.

Sorry for the rant guys. I obviously have issues with my family dynamic, a bunch of people I love and who I get on very well with, but I just wish they would properly commit to this fun thing I'm now obsessed with. I just bought Paris today. I can't stop and I want to share my enthusiasm for board games with someone but this lockdown and my particular family are making it frustrating.

Welcome home, good hunter.

In Bloodborne: The Board Game, one to four players are tasked with the unenviable job of ridding the plague-ridden streets of Yharnam of its beastly curse. Armed with their trick weapons, the hunters scour the alleys and buildings of this decrepit town, overrun and hopeless, as they seek to survive the horrors of the hunt. Will they uncover the truth of the deadly scourge that defiled Yharnam and turned its residents into blood-starved fiends, or will they, too, succumb to the night?

Bloodborne is a campaign-driven dungeon exploration game with a heavy focus on card-based, tactical-dependent decisions wherein players will reveal the secrets of Yharnam's demise over the course of several sessions. Four unique campaigns are available straight out of the core box, with each campaign broken up into three individual chapters, each chapter lasting roughly 60 to 90 minutes. These campaigns include “The Long Hunt,” “Growing Madness,” “Secrets of the Church,” and “Fall of Old Yharnam,” and while each one borrows elements from the video game upon which this is based, this is not an exact one-to-one retelling of that Gothic horror story. Moments and characters will be familiar, but designer Michael Shinall has promised enough different story beats and bumps that even veterans of the video game might be surprised. In fact, it would be closer to say that the events of the board game precede those of the video game.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 8wl4n5g6s3i61...*

Bloodborne: The Board Game offers its fair share of player agency, not just in the way the game plays, but in how you discover – and uncover – its secrets. Each campaign begins in roughly the same way: with a deck of cards that starts with an introduction, and then a setup (which varies depending on the chapter). Setup usually consists of setting aside the specific enemies and tiles needed for this leg of the journey, and then reading a bit of flavor text to explain what's going on. The main objective of each chapter is to complete the Hunt Mission, but before you can even attempt to achieve this, you must gather knowledge about the city and its dangers. This comes in the form of Insight Missions, which are smaller, branching narratives that contextualize what's going on and offer rewards to aid you on your adventure. To progress the Hunt Mission, you must first complete two Insight Missions, of which you are given three options. The decision-making therein comes from the stress of what's called the Hunt Track.

Whenever there is some kind of adaptation from one medium to another, some considerations need to be made. One of these, and perhaps the most noteworthy of all, is the Hunt Track, a ticking time bomb of a round tracker that, should it reach the end, results in the failure of the chapter – and thus, the campaign. For you see, if you should fail any chapter within a campaign, be it the first, second, or third, the whole story comes to a close and you must start again from the beginning of chapter one. It's a cruel and harsh mistress, but one that is necessary to give greater importance to every decision you make. The Hunt Track contains 16 spaces, or rounds, with four of them – spaced every three rounds apart – designated as reset points represented by a blood moon symbol. Every time the round tracker reaches one of these spaces, enemies will respawn and refresh on the map. But I'm getting a little head of myself, I'll get back to that.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rg0blx3as3i61.jpg?width=2358&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41ff047ae1c003dd1de36e3c281a72a3808394b2

The Hunt Track also serves another function, which I alluded to earlier in regards to the Insight Missions, and that's to force players to make a decision – and quickly. Because, even though you have the option to complete three Insight Missions, only two are necessary to actually progress the Hunt and therefore complete the chapter. But at the start of each game, the streets of Yharnam are a blank slate. As you explore, you'll flip over tiles from a stack of locations determined by the setup, so you'll never know what's waiting for you on the other side of a door. It is your job to scour these streets as quickly as possible, slaying any beasts that you must – or avoiding any that you should – and completing these Insight Missions with enough time to spare to still have some wiggle room left for the final objective of the chapter.

On a player's turn, you'll have a number of actions available to you, including Move, Interact, Attack, Transform Weapon, or Return to the Hunter's Dream. All of these actions are performed generally the same – by playing a card. Bloodborne borrows several elements from the deck-building genre, in that everyone's deck of cards starts out identical, but as you improve, gain upgrades, and otherwise find or receive rewards, you begin to shape your playstyle. All of these improvements are also retained from one chapter to the next, until either the completion of the campaign or the hunter's demise. The cards that form your deck are known as Stat cards, and represent a few of the stats from the video game: Endurance, Skill, Strength, and Vitality. Each one has a particular focus, with Strength cards designed to deal more damage, Endurance cards to evade enemy attacks, Skill cards to interrupt an enemy's attack, and Vitality cards to block damage, regain health, or draw additional cards.

To perform an action that isn't attack, simply discard any of your cards. That's it, there's nothing fancy or complicated about it. Drop a card, then perform an action. Want to pick up that consumable? Interact with it by discarding a card and it's yours. To attack, you must be in a space with an enemy and declare your attack, and the way combat works is perhaps my favorite aspect of the game, as I believe this is where the board game is at its most authentic to the video game. Bloodborne the video game – as with all From Software titles in the “Soulsborne” family – is a high-skill-low-luck dance with intense enemy AI. Combat is all about anticipating attacks, outsmarting the enemy, and finding the perfect moment to strike. In the board game, combat begins like so: first, the player will select one of their Stat cards in hand and place it onto their Trick Weapon. Each player, at the start of the game, chooses a Hunter Dashboard and a Trick Weapon. These Trick Weapons are notorious for having two distinct attack modes, and that feeling of having two unique weapon types is carried over wonderfully.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 5xglzg3bs3i61...*

The Trick Weapon dashboard consists of a number of different symbols representing damage and speed, as well as spaces denoting how many attacks that weapon has, but the long-and-short of it is that you have a number of “slots” where you can place a Stat card to modify a particular attack. These attacks deal a certain number of damage and activate at a particular speed level (Fast, Medium, or Slow). Stat cards may do things like add extra damage or speed, or add additional effects like Stagger or Stun, or perhaps even allow the Hunter to draw a card when played, or heal damage after the attack. Each Trick Weapon also contains a reverse side with different attacks and abilities. For example, the Kirkhammer (not in the core box) has a few Medium speed but low damage attacks in its sword form, but on the hammer side has fewer, and slower, but significantly more powerful strikes. After the player selects a Stat card and places it on a slot, the Enemy Action card is flipped.

Enemy Actions is a deck of merely six cards which determine what the enemy will do. All enemy attack patterns are broken down into three categories: Basic, Special, or Ability. Each of these Enemy Action cards represents one of those three actions, and the distribution of the six-card deck favors Basics over the other two (there are three Basics, two Specials, and one Ability). The beauty of this deck is that it is only ever reshuffled after it runs out, meaning the more chances the enemy gets to attack, the more predictable its attacks will become based on the cards that have already been played, and because this one deck functions as the brain of all enemies, you can very easily use it to your advantage. Once the card is flipped, then players have a chance to Dodge if they possess a Dodge card in hand. Dodging, like attacking, must be played to a weapon slot. The key thing to remember here is that when a card is played on the Trick Weapon, it remains locked to that spot until the weapon is transformed, thereby limiting your options in combat the longer you go without transforming. Dodge cards offer the unique benefit of being able to play the card and then immediately clear that very slot, or sometimes clear another slot.

The lynchpin of this entire scenario comes in the form of speed. All actions abide by those three measurements of speed that I mentioned earlier (and in some edge case scenarios, faster than fast and slower than slow). When the player has chosen his or her attack, and the Enemy Action is flipped, both attacks are represented by a speed value. If the player is able to Dodge, that Dodge card must be played to a slot that is at least as fast as the enemy attack or faster. If they cannot, then that attack cannot be dodged. If the attack was not dodged, then both player and enemy attacks will now resolve also following the rule of speed. Fast attacks resolve before Medium, which resolve before Slow. Any attacks occurring at the same speed will resolve simultaneously, which may sometimes lead to attacks potentially canceling each other out based on effects like Stagger, or even resulting in a mutual kill of Hunter and enemy. If the Hunter kills the enemy, they claim a single blood echo and store it on their dashboard, up to a maximum of three. And then they are free to continue performing actions as long as they have cards to do so. Which reminds me, did I mention you only draw three cards every round?

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img tiw35occs3i61...*

Your deck, which consists of 12 cards in equal distributions of the four stats at the beginning, is not an infinite resource. Knowing when, where, and how to dispatch enemies as quickly and safely as possible is absolutely crucial if you hope to survive the hunt long enough to complete the chapter. Should you feel like the streets are far too dangerous, however, you can discard a card to return to the Hunter's Dream. Any time a player returns to the Dream, whether by choice or on death, the Hunt Track will immediately advance by one. It further advances at the end of a single round (that is, once all hunters have taken their turns). Suffice to say, even though there are 16 spaces on the track, that does not mean you have 16 rounds to win. It's something more like 10 when you factor in frequent returns to the Dream. Now remember those reset points I mentioned earlier? Any time the Hunt Track reaches a blood moon, all enemies will respawn on their designated locations, including any enemies that may have previously been engaged in combat. As such, enemies that may have been damaged prior to the reset will be fully healed.

Upon returning to the Dream, however, players are given a bit of respite: all of their health is restored back to the maximum of six; their Trick Weapon is completely refreshed, as is their firearm, a crucial tool necessary to survive the night and provided to all hunters at the onset; and their deck is reshuffled. Additionally, if you have any blood echoes (dying forces you to lose them), you will spend those on Stat upgrades, which are modified versions of the basic cards; however, a Hunter's deck may never exceed 12 cards, so for every upgrade you earn, you must cull another card from your deck. This keeps your choices limited, but also focused and refined, and should you survive long enough to reach the third chapter, you will have a custom-tailored deck hopefully built to synergize with your weapon of choice. All of this is further enhanced by consumables you can find littered throughout the streets, one-time use items that will certainly benefit you on your journey; Hunter Tools, specially-made items crafted by the Hunters of yore to help you survive the night; and Caryll Runes, strange inscriptions depicting the eldritch mutterings of the old ones said to give great power to those who wield them.

Bloodborne: The Board Game is a wonderful recreation of its beloved inspiration, translating into cardboard, paper, and plastic, the elements that best represent the feeling of tension, dread, and triumph that the video game so excellently demonstrated, while accommodating some elements that help ease the transition from one medium to another. It is not entirely without its faults, though many of its problems revolve less around the form and function of the game, but the production surrounding it. That isn't to say the game isn't breathtaking to look at: I mean, look at the miniatures. From the detailed sculpts and tiles, to the stark but clean and legible card design and the easily identifiable iconography across the board, everything just exudes atmosphere evocative of the virtual world upon which it is based. Rather, the issues come from the rulebook itself, and a number of potentially confusing text errors on a few of the campaign cards.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img kin52p5ds3i61...*

With regards to the rulebook, the structure and general explanation is fine, but a game of this magnitude has a fair amount of highly-specific situational issues that a clearer and more complete glossary or index would have been preferential. Furthermore, many of its rules are often vague or easily misinterpreted, the most notable of which are the Insight Missions themselves. The game contains a number of Insight tokens which are often only used to represent phases of an encounter or otherwise keep track of something; however, the Hunt Missions call for players to gain two Insight before proceeding, with no distinction between the Insight tokens and the Insight cards themselves. The completion of an Insight Mission is, in fact, the Insight needed to progress the Hunt (represented by the final card of the Insight Mission), but this confusion could have easily been avoided if the text on the final card said “This counts as one Insight,” or the rules of the Hunt more clearly specified “Complete two Insight Missions.” This is only one of several cases, however, where vague or insufficient wording has lead many players to question the rules. Worse yet, though, are a few cards across different campaigns that have misprinted text or symbols asking players to spawn a particular monster or perform a certain action when such a thing is impossible based on how that scenario was set up. These are, ultimately, issues that can be fixed via errata or an official FAQ, or even just by substituting elements of what the scenario is asking for with what is actually there.

Given the nature and scope of the project, a few mistakes are almost always inevitable, but no less excusable. All that said, Bloodborne: The Board Game succeeds in spite of those foibles, buoyed by a simple yet incredibly diverse combat system wrapped inside a deliciously refined deck building engine that ultimately feels like an advanced game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The exploration of the city and the discovery of the secrets therein, keeping in mind that it will likely be impossible to experience all Insight Missions in a single campaign playthrough (multiplied by four campaigns), sustain the engagement and replayability, as do the numerous options to customize one's deck based on the 60 Stat upgrade cards and four different Trick Weapons to choose from in the core box (and for those interested, those would be the Saw Cleaver, the Hunter Axe, the Threaded Cane, and Ludwig's Holy Blade). With an absolute truckload of additional options to choose from if you partook in some or all of the optional Kickstarter bonuses, there is enough to keep players invested for the foreseeable future.

"This is probably a lot shot, but I’m posting this in hope someone out there knows something or someone with connection to this game.

I live in the UK and this game has forever been on pre-order with TBC release dates or changes dates, or the sites say it is out of stock, as far as I’m aware it has been like this the last 5 months since stumbling across it, can only imagine it’s been like this a lot longer. Even looking into American sites for this games seems to out of stock, the only available option I can find is on amazon in America charging a ludicrous $100 plus $13 shipping too, from what appears to be some kind of store. Obviously I’m not willing to pay this amount for the game but I’ve been desperate to get a copy or at least some kind of information on it.

I’ve spent hours looking online, on Reddit, on news search’s etc. trying to find some kind of information on this games release in the uk or why the game just seems to be non existent now, every time resulting in no one knowing anything or even seeming to ask questions on it. Occasionally I’ll see something saying the amazon price is because it’s out of stock but there’s never any information or update on it coming back into stock or releasing in the UK.

So I’m posting this just in the hope that someone out there knows something please? Would appreciate it so much if anyone is able to help, I’ve dropped a link below just for reference. Thanks in advance.

That being said, she has been enjoying playing My City (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/295486/my-city) the past couple weeks.

Although there is a winner and loser at the end of a game, each player is essentially playing a concurrent solitaire game, with no influence on the other's success.

"I don't often want to rag on online or small gamestores because we're a relatively small hobby and you kind of get what you pay for. We want lower prices which generally means you deal with mom-and-pop type stores but I want to make you guys aware of the nightmare I've had dealing with Macronova Games.    
  
On January 14th I purchased the TI4 Expansion Prophecy of Kings from the Macronova store. Link here: https://www.macronovagames.com/products/twilight-imperium-prophecy-of-kings?utm_source=boardgameprices.com&amp;utm_medium=price-search  
  
The owner makes a big deal stating that they are active duty military and may not always be immediately available to ship from their storage unit. Fair, I understand that, my family is almost entirely active duty military. I figured a working week was a good amount of time seeing as they did not have a notification on their store that the owner was deployed or the store was otherwise unable to process games. Macronova says this about their shipping policy, ""If your order is placed before 12 noon Eastern Time and we have all items in stock then we can usually get it out the same day.  Otherwise it would go out the next day barring any unforeseen circumstances.""
  
After one week of no shipping notification or really any message of any kind I sent Macronova a courteous email asking about the status. After a similar timeframe I sent a facebook message just checking on the order status.  

I waited another week before issuing a chargeback via paypal, at this point I felt there was clearly something wrong and I wasn't being communicated with. Within a few hours of opening the case on paypal I received an email from the owner via the paypal resolution service that the product advertised was a pre-order and that I simply was not issued an automatic email stating that the order can't be sent until ready. Note, there is nothing on that page (previously linked) that identifies it as a preorder. Furthermore, he said he would have one available to ship the next day.  
  
Five days later I received an email that he would not ship while the chargeback case was open on PayPal. I wasn't entirely sure what to do here but I took my chances that he was being truthful (once you cancel a case on paypal you cannot dispute the same charge again). Being done with all of this I closed the case and responded to the email within a day or two. It has now been ten days since that last communication. My game hasn't been shipped. He has ignored two further attempts at communication via the previously discussed methods. It looks like I'm out of my money at this point and I don't really know what to do.  
  
I guess it's my fault for going with a small gaming store like this but I hope it's a lesson to you guys.",boardgames,Disappointed with Macronova Games (A Warning)

"I'm looking for help identifying a board game I had played a couple times at a cousin's house when I was a child back in the early 90s. I remember thinking the game was so cool and would ask to play it every time we visited this cousin, even though it was a bit advanced for me at the time. Any help would be much appreciated! Here's what I remember:

- The theme was high fantasy, in fact I think the title may have had the word dragon in it. A dragon was definitely a central element to it. I think the idea was you played adventurers on a quest to fight/loot the dragon. 
- The art style was dark and dramatic,  reminiscent of a lot of the fantasy book covers you'd see in the 80s/90s.
- In the middle of the board sat a large plastic mountain where the dragon was supposed to be.  It was electronic and lit up, maybe made sounds. 
- The spaces on the board itself were mostly squares,  some of which I specifically remember said ""Bazaar"" (I remember learning the word from this game).
- The rules were a bit on the complicated side,  at least definitely more advanced for a child. The couple times my older cousins gave in and would play it with me I'm pretty sure they dumbed it down a bit for me.

"We played a 4 player game of Clank! Legacy last night. Didn't watch any videos or anything, because we didn't want anything spoiled and wanted to go in blind. 2 of us had played Clank! In Space but it was quite a few years ago, so we were rusty on all of the rules. So basically, we played almost the entire first game thinking that the cubes on the health track were 'clank', so when someone would play a card that said '-2 clank', they would take two cubes off of their track. We had NO idea that the entire right side of the franchise board was where the clank cubes go and the track was actually for our health. We thought it was strange how the rule book talked about 'clank' and 'health', thinking that they were the same thing. It wasn't until two of us had clocked out, that someone grabbed the rule book and reread everything, only to find out that in parentheses it said ""(the banner on the right side)"" when referring to the clank area. 

The crazy thing is, we had two people read the rules, like it had said to do and somehow BOTH of us missed that tiny spot where it explained where clank goes, so we were actually putting the contract cards in that spot. We were all thinking that the game was going on WAY too long and there was no hint of any danger because when the dragon attacked, the most we were pulling was five cubes, so there was no way that any of us would get knocked out.  After we realized that huge mistake we made, we just stopped doing dragon attacks altogether and just finished up and scored. The winner ended up getting like 91 points.

So basically, is there anyway to salvage this? It was a HUGE oversight on our part and I feel like we probably explored a lot more of the board than we were supposed to, because we never felt any sense of urgency to get back. Now that we know where clank goes and that health is a separate thing, are we actually able to continue on and play correctly, or is the whole rest of the game going to be a wash?",boardgames,"So, we missed a very important set-up rule during our first game of Clank!

"I was a big World of Warcraft player since launch and naturally that lead into trying every other mmo since then looking to get into something new.  Which of course never happened and i went back to WOW after a time.  These days I play a lot more board games but i still play here and there on occasion.   Dungeon Crawlers have become my favorite genre but my collection is not that large so i haven't really played a lot of them.  



If i were to ask you as an MMORPG fan what are your favorite dungeon crawlers and why?



I play Descent 2nd edition,  Altar Quest which just released, Dark Souls the board game.



I like the quest and app acting as AI for Descent.  It feels like an MMORPG where you are levelling and gaining experience.  There is a shop event to upgrade gear and spells.  What i think it lacks though is a true end game boss experience like fighting Onyxia in Warcraft is a different experience than fighting Ragnaros.  They are unique with their own AI.  Descent doesn't really feel that way.  



Dark Souls is great because i think it might be the most MMORPG dungeon style game there is.  You fight trash to a mini boss.  Then fight trash to a boss.  The enemies all have unique AI cards.  The bosses have a unique AI deck that randomizes their attacks but its still their own attacks that the other bosses don't have like a tail whip or charge.  



I am desperately trying to find something like Descent 2nd edition up to a boss fight where it turns into Dark Souls/Kingdom Death monster.  But i have not found anything like that.

"Hello everyone, 

We got about a foot of snow in Arkansas (which is about a once in ten years occurrence), so I figured I'd pop on here and do an updated COMC as I watch the snow fall. Since this is my third of these types of posts in about 5 years, I figure I'll skip some of the usual details and focus more on favorite games, where my collection has gone, and how my taste has changed over the years.

**Favorite Games**

I like to keep up with pubmeeple rankings as new games get played. I often do them in two batches, one where I vote strictly on my desire to play that game at that moment (using optimal player count but accounting for set up and tear down) and another where I think about what that game sets out to do and how well it does it. While I did not at all enjoy my play of Leaving Earth, I thought the game executed perfectly what it set out to do. I wouldn't ever want to play it again and therefore ended up outside my personal top 100, but it was inside my top 10 when looking through a more ""objective"" lens. In order to keep things from getting out of control, I'll try to just say one sentence about my picks

Ameritrash: **Twilight Imperium/Nemesis**

\- TI4 w/ PoK is the pinnacle of grand games, complete with an unparalleled level of depth stemming from tech paths, asymmetrical factions, varied map design, and a constantly evolving player meta with a high degree of negotiation

\- Nemesis does what it sets out to do. You're a puny human on an alien infested ship, your survival chances are dismal, as they should be! Kick back and have fun with friends despite the fact you can die in round one (the game lets you play as the aliens so you aren't out completely).

Euro: **Food Chain Magnate/Brass Birmingham**

\- I can't really say anything novel about FCM, it's just such a robustly strategic and tactical game that leaves you thinking about what you could have done more efficiently long after the pieces are back in the box (I'll probably never get through all the expansion content).

Co-op: **Spirit Island/V-Commandos**

\- The most engaging, challenging, and thematic game I've owned to date. I have everything for this game and love how it can scale so well from noobs to experts. The programming mechanisms for the invaders is so well executed.  

Social Deduction: **Deception/Insider**

**-** I've played the popular ones in this genre and Deception and Insider stand out from the pack. Why? Because Secret Hitler and the Resistance just end up being a yelling match and new players often don't understand why they should even care about what's going on. Although Deception can be stressful as the forensic scientist, insider is a breeze and so easy to lose an hour playing.

Filler: **Stockpile/Space Base**

\- My career is in finance and the stock market so this game is right up my alley. Despite the theme, I think it's a good blend of push your luck with some strategy (especially with the expansions). Space base is a more refined version of Machi Koro that I like to use with new players as a filler.

Area Control: **Kemet/Blood Rage**

\- This is one of my favorite genres, probably because I played so much risk as a kid. I really enjoy Kemet's card combat system coupled with the variety of powers you can evolve into. Blood Rage is just a beautifully tight and brutal punching match where everyone is within reach.

**Recent Acquisitions**

**- Anachrony Infinity, Eclipse 2nd Dawn, On Mars, Kanban EV, Escape Plan, and Vinhos**

I'm an avid board game trader and like to participate in math trades. I've traded about 50 games at this point so I've seen a lot of games come and go. I would get rid of more games on my shelf, but the wife likes the lighter games so they still have a roof over their head, haha.

**State of My Collection**

**-** At this time, there aren't any games on my acquisition list. I feel that my collection is honestly exactly where I want it to be. I have a KS outstanding for Nemesis Lockdown, but that's the only pre-order left on the table. I've been in the hobby long enough to know this period of calm won't last, but I'm content for the time being!

**What I've Learned**

\- I will almost always skew toward a heavy game. I love the mental crunch of trying to solve a puzzle and best my buddies. Additionally, It's become extremely apparent to me that I have no desire to play a euro game with a high level of RNG. As such, I consider Wingspan and Tapestry to be some of my least favorite games of all time. I have gotten rid of Viticulture this month for similar reasons (though it was arguably much less offensive than other SM games). I'm perfectly fine with things being dependent on luck (I love Nemesis after all), but I just can't stomach that in euro game trappings. 

**Which Games Am I Missing?**

\- Here is my [list](https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/GorditaCrunch93?prevowned=1&amp;subtype=boardgame&amp;ff=1) of traded games, which some having never hit the table due to a good trade offer. That said, which games do you think I should look into that would complete my collection?

I put this together on a whim a few years ago, and was pretty pleased with how it turned out. I had actually put together [a Tabletop Simulator mod](https://i.imgur.com/RfHYEen.jpg) for it on Steam, but just a few months ago it got DMCA'd by Rio Grande Games because I used the actual Dominion logo on my card backs.

"[The collection](https://i.imgur.com/rIGiBSD.jpg)

A little background about me. I am 36 and I’ve been playing board and video games my whole life. My wife and I got married almost 6 years ago and we regularly played rummy, did puzzles and the occasional game of guillotine.  But it was about 4 years ago when we got the game that would launch us into modern board games, Carcassonne.  We played it nearly every night for a year or more.  Eventually, I started looking around to see if there were other games out there that we could have the same amounts of fun with, and that led me to r/boardgames and BGG. We added some games like Azul and Forbidden Island and we were hooked. The collection has grown since then and we have had some duds along the way, but we still play about 3-4x per week and I have a group at my office who I play games with at lunch about once per week. 

My favorites:
1. Carcassonne
2. The Quest for El Dorado
3. Viticulture with Tuscany
4. Agricola
5. Five tribes 

Wife’s favorites
1. Carcassonne 
2. 7 Wonders Duel
3. Viticulture with Tuscany 
4. Azul
5. Sagrada

Work groups favorites
1.  The Quest for El Dorado 
2. Men at Work
3. Forbidden Island
4. Azul
5. For Sale

What would I change about my collection? 
I just got rid of 4 games so I’m feeling pretty good about it currently, though there are some that barely get played. In part, that is because of COVID, so we haven’t had a game night with friends in about a year. I probably won’t get rid of any more until after social restrictions lift and I see if games actually start getting played more. Games that could be on their way to the chopping block eventually are:
1. Star Realms. I play the app all the time but my wife hates it. 
2. Inis. I am really hoping to play this one more, it is so fun, but My wife has been reluctant to play it much. 
3. Spirit Island. I love the game, but it is a bit too complicated for my wife to enjoy.  I may still keep it for the very occasional solo play or if I find someone that’s into it. 
4. Hive. My wife will not play this with me after a long win streak haha. 
5. Mr. Jack. I really like it but my wife isn’t that into the cat and mouse feel. 

My newest addition is Five Tribes about a month ago and it has turned into an instant classic for us. 

Games I have on my radar to purchase:
1. Camel Up. I think my work group would absolutely love it. 
2. Pandemic Legacy.  I haven’t played any legacy games before, but my wife and I like co-ops and have had fun the base pandemic we borrowed from a friend. 
3. The King Is Dead 2e. I’m considering purging Inis from my collection and adding this but not sure about it. I’m not sure which would be more likely to get played more. 
4. Century: Golem. We don’t have any engine builders, and I didn’t like Splendor, so I thought this one could be cool.",boardgames,[COMC] My small(ish) 4 year collection

"Hello all,

I decided to pay $4 and try out Board Game Arena and overall quite impressed. Admittingly I really haven't heard about Board Game Arena until a couple months ago. I love digital version of games compared to tabletop simulator. Just is so nice not having to do math etc...

We played Res Arcana , Potion Explosion, Santorini and Dice Forge. I pretty much enjoyed every game and noticed no bugs. In your experience have there been a lot of bugs in games that aren't in beta?

I feel like paying $2-4 a month to play over 200+ digital board games is just such a good deal. Oddly most the games I don't know how to play so I am going to have to learn some :)

Res Arcana was definitely my favorite game so far on there. We were about to try it out on tabletop simulator and I noticed it was on Board Game Arena so we tried it on there and I personally was quite amazed. It pretty much felt just as a good as a steam game.

I know there is a lot of controversy going on right now but there really doesn't seem to be a better way to play board games online. Between Steam + Board Game Arena I will be quite happy :).",boardgames,Board Game Arena

Given the LOTR theme, the **War of the Ring** background, I’d expect **Hunt for the Ring** should be rating beyond 8.0. Some reviews such as Dice Tower didn’t help but some reviewers like Eddy from Drive Thru (one I respect a lot) say this is their most favourite hidden movement game. 

For me, **Letters from Whitechapel** drags too much, **Fury of Dracula** is too convoluted, **Whitehall** is too short and **Narcos** is a bit messy and fiddly. Hunt for the Ring interests me a lot but to find it at 7.2 at BGG makes me wonder.

"I'm interested in hearing about what really makes different mechanics for different people.  If you have a mechanic (or genre, even, the difference is a little rough for me sometimes) that you're particularly fond of, be it deck building, worker placement, area control, or whatever comes to mind for you, I'd love to hear from you.

I'm interested in hearing about games that you feel like are great examples of them.  I'd also like to hear about instances where the game might have missed the mark, in your opinion.  But what I'd really love to hear are responses from people who have something for each, and might be willing to go into what's so different between the two.

**How long have you been involved in the hobby?**       
Around 3 years. Played things like Monopoly, Loopin' Louie (hallowed be thy name o looping one) and Upwords as a kid. Father introduced me to Catan in high school (which we played as a family many times). Only got *DEEP* into the hobby by starting my own collection around 3 years ago when my friends had a board game night and I had a great time playing games I hadn't seen before - mostly gateway fillers like Anomia, Taboo and Camel Cup which looked toooo complicated for me at the time (haha). 
    
**And then?**   
My earliest purchases were 7 Wonders (which I pulled off the shelf assuming it would be a civilisation building game like Age of Empires or something and turned out to be a pure drafting game :s) and Catan 5-6 player expansion. From then on I like to do a lot of researching before making purchases. The BGG top 100 *used* to be a compass in this regard but it's definitely more of a popularity contest vs any sort of objective quality of game design measurement. Discovering SUSD's YouTube (and then other bgame YouTuber's) was also a major influence but again I realised their taste and mine weren't completely congruent (Fog of Love bounced off me HARD). Now I stay very up to date with board game news via this sub and my favourite bgame media So Very Wrong About Games (a podcast).
    
**What would you change about your collection if you could?**   
The pragmatist in me would like to downsize my collection into a concise amount of games that I love dearly and get regular plays. I definitely have a bit of a collector spirit in myself (I'm the type to hunt down and buy all the existing content for a game once I know I like it) and I have a bad habit of buying a game literally just to try it a handful of times to experience the new idea it brings to the table only just to sell it on the secondary market for a loss. I am a sucker for unique novelty games that might not be **excellent** but still offer something that other games in my collection don't. I still believe I'm still quite new to the hobby and have a lot to learn so I want to continue trying as many games that are new to me as possible (hopefully playing them through meetups/friends copies instead of buying them myself). I'd also like to consolidate the whole collection on a massive shelf (I think they call them Caltexes? Kelloggses?) but current living arrangements prevent me from doing so.    
     
**Type of Gamer**  
I find myself drawn to   
*Interactive economic Games (euros or 18xx) or really anything where you make money haha   
*Socially interactive games (social deduction/trading/negotiation/bluffing)   
*Satisfying resource conversion/engine building games    
*Novel/unique party games   
  
While typing that I just realised there's not much that doesn't cover. I guess I do enjoy ALL types of games as long as I feel the design is a) mechanically solid and offers interesting decisions and b) offers something unique or at least delivers on whatever its core promise within the game is e.g. I hate it when there is randomness in games that are supposed to be long and strategic or fiddliness and downtime in games that are supposed to be short and punchy. I dislike games without focus that feel like mechanics drawn together. I also have extra dislike towards games that are overproduced but not very good because I'm disappointed the quality of the game design didn't match its production. 

**Favourite Game**  
Food Chain Magnate. I've always appreciated how ""pure"" this was from a game design and play experience perspective. It is literally just cards that interact with tokens on a map. There are no extraneous tracks or hidden objectives or one shot abilities or long card text effects - the focus is so singular on competing to sell food to make money. In my opinion it is the best implementation of a tech tree in a game and the feeling of progression and development in the game is so tangible (one of my favourite feelings in games, why I enjoy engine building games so much too). 
    
**Popular games I dislike**   
*Dune: Imperium   
I felt like deck building was done pretty poorly and just contributed to the randomness within the game. Having your only 2 actions before a hugely consequential scoring conflict be tied to random card draw felt frustrating and restrictive.   
*On Mars  
Felt like a complete mish-mash of mechanics with no focus. Every action in the game has a bundle of mechanics with sub restrictions and they're all tied together. Having actions be separated and necessitate the need of planning to board the rocket to take those actions just felt annoying and not the type of rewarding planning I'd like to engage with. The game encourages you to help build the communal LSS but my friend has scored more points just upgrading his player board and not engaging with buildings at all.  
*Terraforming Mars   
This I think is an okay game but I don't understand the immense following behind it. The production is terrible. The game itself is playable yes but not very memorable to me - there's nothing that stands out. It's up to the player to create their own fun with cards that may or may not synergise at all together (i.e. perfect or kind of useless since there are so many) which furthers my suspicion of a rather unrefined game.      
*Great Western Trail   
I've only played this once but had such a terrible time the experience really stuck with me. I was last in turn order and thus priority to get good cowboys which left me in a position where it was too late to pivot strategy and impossible to deliver more valuable cows. The person with the best cows just kept going round and round the rondel and obviously won. I've since heard of the cowboy strat being the low hanging fruit and other strategic viabilities being introduced in the expansion but my really sour first play was just very disappointing with a runaway leader - at least in FCM pivoting in strategy is somewhat doable late game and I have seen surprise comebacks.    
*This list is getting too long so I'm going to cut it off now but getting those off my chest felt good LOL
    
**Not so popular games I do like**   
*Unicorn Fever is slightly over-gamified for its own good. It's a bit too long and gamery for something that's literally betting over extremely random events but I love it for that.   
*Sons of Anarchy is a very silly game that I LOVE for its chaotic randomness and lack of rules restrictions (I love games that feature open negotiation and trading).     
*Dice Fishing Roll and Catch is a game where you bet dice over who can achieve a particular dice roll result with fewer dice and it might just be my favourite dice game.    
     
**Preordered games**   
[this embarrassingly large list from BGG with a LOT of preordered 18xx on the way](https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/jibibgg?preordered=1&amp;subtype=boardgame&amp;ff=1)   
KS tends to have unique themes, interesting mechanics and a much higher level of production you don't see as often in the mass market retail release space. I try to avoid the really ""baity"" ones (CMON KS just seem fishy to me) but I have backed some stupid KS just out of curiosity. Outsmarted! and Hogs of War the miniatures game being some of them.

I was last in turn order and thus priority to get good cowboys which left me in a position where it was too late to pivot strategy and impossible to deliver more valuable cows. The person with the best cows just kept going round and round the rondel and obviously won. I've since heard of the cowboy strat being the low hanging fruit and other strategic viabilities being introduced in the expansion but my really sour first play was just very disappointing with a runaway leader - at least in FCM pivoting in strategy is somewhat doable late game and I have seen surprise comebacks. 
    
**Not so popular games I do like**   
I think Unicorn Fever is slightly over-gamified for its own good. It's a bit too long and gamery for something that's literally betting over extremely random events but I love it for that. Sons of Anarchy is a very silly game that I LOVE for its chaotic randomness and lack of rules restrictions (I love games that feature open negotiation and trading). Dice Fishing Roll and Catch is a game where you bet dice over who can achieve a particular dice roll result with fewer dice and it might just be my favourite dice game. 
     
**Preordered games**   
[this embarrassingly large list from BGG with a LOT of preordered 18xx on the way](https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/jibibgg?preordered=1&amp;subtype=boardgame&amp;ff=1)   
KS tends to have unique themes, interesting mechanics and a much higher level of production you don't see as often in the mass market retail release space. I try to avoid the really ""baity"" ones (CMON KS just seem fishy to me) but I have backed some stupid KS just out of curiosity. Outsmarted! and Hogs of War the miniatures game being some of them.

"My wife and I live in cold weather and have been getting into more board games during the pandemic. We tried gloomhaven today and loved it, with one caveat. My wife thought it would be fun to read everything in a British accent and it made me want to kill again. To prevent this I got the Forteller audio narration and was pleasantly surprised by how good and immersive it made the whole experience. A little pricey at $15 ( $10 for jaws of the lion) but didn’t mind supporting a small business. 

Would recommend if you want to do your setup and play the narration at the same time",boardgames,The audio narration for Gloomhaven is pretty good!
"This question is actually for cards for Horrified, but I figured I would ask for Carcassonne as its a way more popular game.

Just wondering what website would offer the same paper quality and width (weight) as Carcassonne quality? It's super thick paper with a gkoss finish of sort.

I want to solve this issue once and for all. Doesn't matter the price. Obviously if it's over the top I won't order, but I just want to know.

Maybe its a question for boardgamedesign, but I figured I'd start here :)",boardgames,Where can I print identical width + paper quality as Carcassonne?
Silent Victory is mainly a solo submarine war-game. It says it can handle a few more players if you want.

So, the first edition of the subject insert says it works with the base and Ambition. The second edition says it works with both expansions.

"It seems that every game has an expansion, if not multiple expansions. I am told some are integral for an even better game. I have been told there are ones that are blatant cash grabs and they ruin the game if used. I have bought both. 

My ""Must Have"" is the 1910 Expansion. After a number of games it is easy go know where routes are going. Adding this in gives a larger variety and makes it harder to guess routes.

I think I’ve narrowed my search down to Betrayal Legacy (my runner up was Terraforming Mars, but it seemed a little to nutty gritty for us) because of its large mixture of story telling and exploration.

"I just bought Eclipse 1st edition after randomly running across it for $50 at Half Price Books. The day before I had watched some glowing reviews of 2nd edition.

Does anyone have experience with both editions? Do you think it is worth upgrading at some point to 2nd edition (which is seemed to be $250 USD TO $350 USD)? Can I just use the 2nd edition rule set with 1st edition or are there standard house rules I should use for 1st edition?

"A few years ago Soda Pop Minatures put out a video-boardgame/dungeon battler called ""Super Dungeon Explore"". Looked kind of fun, but I think it got blown out a while later by CMON's ""Arcadia Quest"". I ended up not getting either one, but lately I have found myself looking for a good dungeon exploring/quasi-rpg light style game. And I was thinking about one particular mechanic from SDE that I thought was pretty cool. To equip new weapons and armor, you would slide the cards under your character card in the appropriate side or slot. like a new weapon would attach to the right side and new armor or boots might be added to the bottom.

It's a small thing, just an interesting detail that I thought was pretty intuitive but I haven't seen it used anywhere else since then. I was wondering if you guys had seen that used anywhere else, and while I'm here I should go ahead and solicit suggestions for cool exploration/dungeon crawl games!

Thanks in advance for any info!",boardgames,A cool mechanic I haven't seen used anywhere else.

I have Mysterium with all expansions and we don't play it that often. I like that Park works great with 2 players and is less fiddly.

The couple were pressing colored buttons that would light up and every now and then the game would say “blue up” , etc and the couple would have to flip the game up or down and so forth. It reminded me of “bop it” mixed with “twister” kind of. Anyway, I forgot to write the game’s name down and now for al the google, TikTok, history searching in the world I can’t find it.

I would really like to play more Pax Pamir 2e (I think Cole Wehrle is such a great designer!), Caverna, and Everdell.

"Hello all! 

I reached the 8 year mark today since my first purchase of The Settlers of Catan way back in 2013 and just felt like celebrating/reflecting a bit! 

The Catan expansions, Bang! and Munchkin all followed slowly (because of college and tuition), but over the past 5 years, I have come to know how welcoming (Five Crowns/Ticket To Ride), special (Viticulture), redemptive (Monopoly Deal!), nostalgic (Villainous), story-filled (Fog Of Love), better-than-chess (Hive/Santorini), eye-catching (Sagrada), debatable (Wavelength), uncompromising (Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective), artistic (Santa Monica), frantic (Anomia), cooperative (The Crew), weird (Bohnanza), crunchy (Concordia), satisfying (Patchwork/Ganz Schon Clever/Welcome To), creative (Dixit), hilarious (chunky (Junk Art/Schummel Hummel), flexiblesuspenseful (Deception/Letter from Whitechapel), addictive (Quacks) and interesting (Keyflower) board games can truly be! 

They meant a particularly great deal to me and my fiancè during quarantine (this is largely a collection that works well with two players)! 

I have reached a point where I am open to recommendations as far as filling essential gaps in the collection, but have already passed the ""MUST. BUY. EVERYTHING!"" craze 😆

Many thanks to this subreddit community for all your support and insight!

"I'm wondering if anybody has an opinion about the effect of the ""Sheepified!"" curse in the 5 Minute Dungeon expansion. Specifically, if you are playing with the Druid as one of the characters, is it possible to eliminate the curse, or can you only use the Druid's ability to move the curse to the bottom of the Dungeon Deck, ensuring that it will be active during the final fight with the Dungeon Master? 

The conclusion that we have come to in our family is that you cannot remove this specific curse if you are playing with the Druid, as the ""Cleanse"" card that the Druid would otherwise be able to play cannot be played, as it is an Action Card that is specifically blocked by the Curse. Additionally, you cannot use the ""Curse Zapper"" Artifact, as it won't be available because the Druid is one of the active characters. 

If the conclusion above is correct, it also seems that the if you are playing with the Druid and the Valkyrie/Paladin, that you will not be able to use the Holy Hand Grenade against the Dungeon Master, as it is an Action Card specifically blocked by the Sheepified! curse.

Dune is a fantastic game that combines worker placement and deck building, but really nails it on the interaction between players and choices on what cards to use and not to use. I highly recommend you try this game. But, the one thing the game doesn't do well, are the components.

"I got my kickstarter fulfillment of [Overboss: A Boss Monster Adventure](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brotherwise/overlord-a-boss-monster-adventure/description) late last night and began cardboard punching today. I went with the Tower Edition pledge that included a tile tower from Broken Token and a market board.  

They used a company called Game Trayz to create the in-box storage for it, and boy oh boy, it is something else. The bottom tray houses all the terrain tiles with space underneath them for corresponding monster and crystal tokens. The center section holds additional tokens, cards, and boss mats. It's somewhat self contained and has a clear plastic snap on cover to keep everything nice and snug so you don't have a box of loose terrain after storing it on its side in your Kallax.

Then, there's a secondary tray that rests on top. I figured that the tile tower would just always sit nearby, built, waiting to be used. Nope, they even included storage for the tower when it is broken down. On top of the tower, it holds the scoresheet and player mats. Everything lines up perfectly. Then the box closes off with little wiggle room.

I'm really impressed with the work that was put into it. I only hope that this is added to the retail package.

A few months ago, I made some [Catan/Seafarer player trays and organizer](https://www.etsy.com/listing/895154153/catan-and-seafarers-5-6-player) and they have been pretty popular. I recently got Ticket to Ride and figured I would try and design something for TtR. It took 4 tries to get it to a point where I was happy. At first, I didn't have a tiny lip/railing on the card shelves, which you can't see well in the pics, and the cards would slide off. After adding the railing, they stay on pretty good. Then I realized that the lid moved a little too freely, so I added a little bump on the side of the side near the hinge that sort of locks it into the up right position. 

I thought about adding a mechanism to help hold the lid shut like with my Catan trays, but I don't think thats necessary here. On the Catan trays the pieces would fall out. If the lid came open a little bit. That won't happen here.

I added the divider wall thinking that it might help for using it for other purposes. And it turned out that it helps with grabbing the pieces as well. 

What do you guys think of the train on the lid? I like how it turned out, but I can understand if some people might see it as tacky. Honest opinions on that would be nice. 

The design is pretty simple, but do you have any suggestions on improvement? Should I try to adapt it to any of the alternative TtR games/expansions?

As for the game time, it doesn't really matter to me or my buddies, and as for the genre, we like sci-fi, dark fantasy and we also love the game Hearts of iron IV, so a board game based around world war II would be great too.

"Dune is a fantastic game that combines worker placement and deck building, but really nails it on the interaction between players and choices on what cards to use and not to use. I highly recommend you try this game. But, the one thing the game doesn't do well, are the components.

I find it really lacking and quite frankly: dull. The soldiers are cubes, the spice are hexagonal wooden things and money is grey wooden discs. Water is okay-ish, with blue tear-drops. But all in all: very uninspired. Of course Dire Wolf offers an upgrade kit that enhances some of these aspects, but not all. And, it's not out yet.

"I've never been consistently painting through the years but when I got this beautiful game I knew I had to start do something again.

Sadly, I don't have any decent camera and had to take all pics with my phone which resulted as a pain in the ass to get some bad quality pics. It's whatever. I also took a pic using natural light though the weather was gloomy.

That said, here is what's maybe my top 2 favourite character from the game: Sir William Yorick.

Glowing eyes were a sort of trick to balance out the very poor model quality and to don't make any attempt to paint realistic eyes on such a small and undetailed mini (also I'm fucking terrible at painting eyes), and since the investigators are still capable of casting spells I imagined him using some sort of spirit vision to investigate on the skeletal remains.

"This post is probably more indepth than it needs to be, but Diplomacy is a bit of a niche board game so I figured I'd introduce it before talking about the tournament itself. The tl;dr though, is that the 28 highest ranked Diplomacy players in the world are about to face off against one another for what is likely the most prestigious award in Diplomacy history - and there'll be live commentary alongside it!

**What is Diplomacy?**

Diplomacy is a negotiation-based board game which was first released in 1959. Seven players each take control of a great power in the first world war, aiming to take Europe for their own. It's known for being long and brutal - and when I say brutal, I really mean it.

*""I've seen grown men cry playing Diplomacy""* - Tom Vasel, The Dice Tower
*""Diplomacy wounds run deep, and take a lifetime to heal""* - Wil Wheaton, Tabletop
*""It's just hell, Diplomacy, in a wonderful way""* - Matt Lees, Shut Up &amp; Sit Down

If you want to watch a great video about Diplomacy, I highly recommend Oliver Lugg's [Diplomacy: The Game of Knife](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUaLEgzvMQs). I'll only be covering a small bit here.

**Why is Diplomacy so brutal?**

That comes down to the way the game is played. It's divided into 15 minute phases, and the board itself only really comes into play at the end of each phase. The rest of the time, players will be scattering to separate rooms to discuss deals, alliances, and warplans behind closed doors.

Players then write down their orders in secret. This is important, because in Diplomacy, *nothing* is binding. All orders are revealed at the same time at the end of the phase, so you won't know whether your 'ally' is actually helping you, or whether they just wanted you to move to that province so they could launch a surprise attack on you, until it's already happened.

Combine this with player elimination being a possibility (in fact, it happens in almost every game), and the board game usually taking 8-12 hours straight, and Diplomacy becomes one of the most intense experiences you can have in a board game. Emotions run high, and being lied to and brutally stabbed in the back by someone you've been working with for the past 6 hours can break people.

This is not a gateway game. I do not recommend playing this game with friends unless you know they are the kind of people who can handle it.

As you can probably imagine, Diplomacy is a game that works best at a competitive level. The intensity is amplified, but at the same time, the players at that level are (generally) calculating, ruthless, and most importantly, used to betrayal. They're there to win, and even when things have been going against them for hours, they'll still be fighting to survive and looking for that inroad in negotiations that could let them back into the game.

**What is the DBNI?**

Prior to 2020, there were two main ways to play Diplomacy - Face to Face, which is the board game as I've described it above, and Extended Deadline, usually played online, which uses written messages and 24 hour phases. Most Diplomacy is played in Extended Deadline format, because you can sit down to write out messages for an hour whenever you're free instead of having to schedule 8 hours on a specific day to play.

As a result of the pandemic, a new format has recently emerged - virtual Face to Face, with voice chat over discord - that has seen a huge resurgence in tournament play. December saw the Virtual World Diplomacy Classic, which ended up being the largest FtF-style Diplomacy Tournament since 2006. And in among all that, a few players founded the Diplomacy Broadcast Network, which gives esports-style live commentary on these vFtF Tournaments.

Alongside that, the DBN has been keeping a ranking of players based on their tournament results over the year, in both formats. After the most recent tournament, they invited the highest ranking 28 players to compete for the DBN Diplomat of the Year Award in the Diplomacy Broadcast Network Invitational. The tournament will take place in four rounds over two weekends (this weekend and next weekend), plus a Grand Final on February 26th.

**Why is the DBNI so important in the Diplomacy world?**

Simple answer, there's never been an event like this before. The traditional World Championship for Diplomacy is open to all, which allows for it to be huge, but also means the skill level varies quite significantly. There have been invitationals which brought together top level players, but mainly top level players who could afford to travel to whatever location they were being held in, as Diplomacy isn't something you get sponsored for. Due to the way vFtF works, there was no monetary barrier to qualifying for and participating in the DBNI, and although a few players in the top 28 couldn't make time for it (notably three time world champion Andrew Goff, who you might know from the recent [Popular Mechanics article](https://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/gaming/a34043608/winning-diplomacy-strategy-andrew-goff/)), the vast majority accepted their invitations.

There is a very solid argument that the DBNI is the most prestigious FtF-style tournament in the 60 years since Diplomacy was created.

**How can I watch the DBNI?**

I'm glad you asked! The Diplomacy Broadcast Network will be covering all four rounds and the grand final.

**Why am I posting about this?**

If you've been on the board game subreddit for a long time, you might know me as that guy who posted an essay about [the longest game of Diplomacy ever](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/3zx275/the_2012_webdiplomacy_world_cup_final_has_reached/), which lasted about 3 and a half years, and in which the first world war lasted for over a century. To say I'm obsessed with this game might not be going far enough; I've been playing Diplomacy online almost continuously for the past nine years, and also run a youtube channel about the game.

I managed to qualify for the DBNI (by the skin of my teeth) so I'll be playing! I'm not allowed to reveal which rounds I'm playing in, but if you do tune in, keep an eye out for the Brit. That's me, and I'm hyped beyond belief.

I also think the live commentary DBN has been doing is fantastic, and I'd like to spread the word beyond just the immediate Diplomacy hobby.

Hi everyone,

over the past few months, I have gone through a few Lacerda's, namely Escape Plan, The Gallerist and now CO2 2nd chance. Given the pandemics, I have only played them solo.

Each of those games is quite complex, although probably not among his most complex ones. Still, they require quite a bit of time before playing to get one's mind around the rules (reading the rulebook, watching playthroughs...). And then, I always have a weird feeling after a few games (I try to play 3-4 times in a row over a maximum of 2 weeks so that rules stay fresh)...as although I do like the puzzle when I play, I don't feel the urge to play more. This might be because I have quite a long list of other new games to try (including other Lacerdas) but I also wonder if the lack of ""initial variability"" is not an issue for me.

Indeed, I am also a great fan of asymmetric card games such as CCGs, or games such as Smash up, Battle Con or games such as Project Gaia or Root where there are different characters/races/factions each with different strategies, with said strategies changing according to the matchup. In my view, this makes for infinite exploration and replayability.

When I play a Lacerda, I don't get this. I find there is an initial exploration as you discover new strategies, but I don't feel the urge to explore it that much as I don't see that many different paths to winning. I get that there are obviously ways to get better and become more efficient as you explore the game more but I don't find this really alluring. This may be due to the fact that I played mostly solo and that those games mostly shine multiplayer whereby you are able to find 2-3 like-minded players and you are forced to fight for resources, react to their actions...

But still, I wonder compared to a game such as Project Gaia with different factions why anyone would prefer a game without variable player powers. Well, I acknowledge that in that case, balance can be an issue.

Anyhow, all remarks (or experiences) are welcome. I wonder if other people feel like me.

Once again, I am not trying to besmirch Lacerda's games...I own most of them and still needs to play his recent ones, because, in a sense, I like how everything is intrincately linked...but I have the feeling they might become stale for me rather quickly.

thanks.",boardgames,"Lack of variability in symmetric Euros (e.g., Lacerda's games) ?"

"Hey everyone !  


I bought Rising Sun weeks ago and I love the game.   
About season cards, we followed the rules : we revealed the cards only when the new season starts.  


But now we will start playing with extra monsters from kickstarter/monster pack, and I am wondering if the best approach wouldn't be to reveal the 3 seasons cards right from the beginning of the game.  
Indeed, monsters can have really huge impact on the game : for instance, Dokaiju would change the way you build your strongholds ... But we could also play with the ""surprise reveal"" of cards, and then play seasons while gambling about the fact that X monster will or will not be available.  


How do you people choose to handle this ?
