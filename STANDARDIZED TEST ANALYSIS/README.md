# Project 1: Standardized Test Analysis

## SAT and ACT Data analysis from 2017 to 2019.

### Problem Statement
This analysis aims at exploring various data trends in the SAT and ACT scores in the United States from 2017 to 2019. For this purpose, I have used Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scipy and Matplotlib for data exploration, analysis, visualizations, and statistical computing. While performing statistical computing I discovered that most of the mid-west states have performed better comparing the rest of United States. Meanwhile, I created a list of top ten best states in terms of their SAT scores and similarly top ten worst performing states in terms of SAT scores from 2017 to 2019.
